  <div class="content">
    <h2 id="template">TEMPLATE</h2>
<h3 id="goals-for-this-year">Goals for this year:</h3>
<p>List your major goals here! Sharing your goals with your manager &amp; coworkers is
really nice because it helps them see how they can support you in accomplishing
those goals!</p>
<h3 id="goals-for-next-year">Goals for next year</h3>
<p>If it’s getting towards the end of the year, maybe start writing down what you
think your goals for next year might be.</p>
<h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>
<p>For each one, go through:</p>
<ul>
<li>What your contributions were (did you come up with the design? Which
components did you build?</li>
<li>Was there some useful insight like “wait, we can cut scope and do what we want
by doing way less work” that you came up with?)</li>
<li>The impact of the project – who was it for?</li>
<li>Are there numbers you can attach to it? (saved X dollars? shipped new feature
that has helped sell Y big deals?</li>
<li>Improved performance by X%? Used by X internal users every day?).</li>
<li>Did it support some important non-numeric company goal (required to pass an
audit? helped retain an important user?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember: don’t forget to explain what the results of you work actually were!
It’s often important to go back a few months later and fill in what actually
happened after you launched the project.</p>
<h3 id="collaboration-mentorship">Collaboration &amp; mentorship</h3>
<p>Examples of things in this category:</p>
<pre><code>Helping others in an area you’re an expert in (like “other engineers
regularly ask me for one-off help solving weird bugs in their CSS” or
“quoting from the C standard at just the right moment”) Mentoring interns &#x2F;
helping new team members get started Writing really clear emails&#x2F;meeting
notes Foundational code that other people built on top of Improving
monitoring &#x2F; dashboards &#x2F; on call Any code review that you spent a
particularly long time on &#x2F; that you think was especially important
Important questions you answered (“helped Risha from OTHER_TEAM with a lot
of questions related to Y”) Mentoring someone on a project (“gave Ben advice
from time to time on leading his first big project”) Giving an internal talk
or workshop
</code></pre>
<h3 id="design-documentation">Design &amp; documentation</h3>
<p>List design docs &amp; documentation that you worked on</p>
<pre><code>Design docs: I usually just say “wrote design for X” or “reviewed design for
X” Documentation: maybe briefly explain the goal behind this documentation
(for example “we were getting a lot of questions about X, so I documented it
and now we can answer the questions more quickly”)
</code></pre>
<h3 id="company-building">Company building</h3>
<p>This is a category we have at work – it basically means “things you did to help
the company overall, not just your project / team”. Some things that go in here:</p>
<pre><code>Going above &amp; beyond with interviewing or recruiting (doing campus
recruiting, etc) Improving important processes, like the interview process
or writing better onboarding materials
</code></pre>
<h3 id="what-you-learned">What you learned</h3>
<p>My friend Julian suggested this section and I think it’s a great idea – try
listing important things you learned or skills you’ve acquired recently! Some
examples of skills you might be learning or improving:</p>
<pre><code>how to do performance analysis &amp; make code run faster internals of an
important piece of software (like the JVM or Postgres or Linux) how to use a
library (like React) how to use an important tool (like the command line or
Firefox dev tools) about a specific area of programming (like localization
or timezones) an area like product management &#x2F; UX design how to write a
clear design doc a new programming language
</code></pre>
<p>It’s really easy to lose track of what skills you’re learning, and usually when
I reflect on this I realize I learned a lot more than I thought and also notice
things that I’m not learning that I wish I was. Outside of work</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It’s also often useful to track accomplishments outside of work, like:</p>
<p>blog posts talks/panels open source work Industry recognition</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think this can be a nice way to highlight how you’re thinking about your
career outside of strictly what you’re doing at work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This can also include other non-career-related things you’re proud of, if that
feels good to you! Some people like to keep a combined personal + work brag
document.</p>
<h3 id="general-prompts">General prompts</h3>
<h3 id="if-you-re-feeling-stuck-for-things-to-mention-try">If you’re feeling stuck for things to mention, try:</h3>
<pre><code>If you were trying to convince a friend to come join your company&#x2F;team, what
would you tell them about your work? Did anybody tell you that you did
something well recently?
</code></pre>
