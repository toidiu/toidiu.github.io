  <div class="content">
    <h2 id="template">TEMPLATE</h2>
<h3 id="goals-for-this-year">Goals for this year:</h3>
<p>List your major goals here! Sharing your goals with your manager &amp; coworkers is
really nice because it helps them see how they can support you in accomplishing
those goals!</p>
<h3 id="goals-for-next-year">Goals for next year</h3>
<p>If it’s getting towards the end of the year, maybe start writing down what you
think your goals for next year might be.</p>
<h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>
<p>For each one, go through:</p>
<ul>
<li>What your contributions were (did you come up with the design? Which
components did you build?</li>
<li>Was there some useful insight like “wait, we can cut scope and do what we want
by doing way less work” that you came up with?)</li>
<li>The impact of the project – who was it for?</li>
<li>Are there numbers you can attach to it? (saved X dollars? shipped new feature
that has helped sell Y big deals?</li>
<li>Improved performance by X%? Used by X internal users every day?).</li>
<li>Did it support some important non-numeric company goal (required to pass an
audit? helped retain an important user?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember: don’t forget to explain what the results of you work actually were!
It’s often important to go back a few months later and fill in what actually
happened after you launched the project.</p>
<h3 id="collaboration-mentorship">Collaboration &amp; mentorship</h3>
<p>Examples of things in this category:</p>
<pre class="giallo" style="color: #EBDBB2; background-color: #32302F;"><code data-lang="plain"><span class="giallo-l"><span>Helping others in an area you’re an expert in (like “other engineers</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>regularly ask me for one-off help solving weird bugs in their CSS” or</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>“quoting from the C standard at just the right moment”) Mentoring interns /</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>helping new team members get started Writing really clear emails/meeting</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>notes Foundational code that other people built on top of Improving</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>monitoring / dashboards / on call Any code review that you spent a</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>particularly long time on / that you think was especially important</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>Important questions you answered (“helped Risha from OTHER_TEAM with a lot</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>of questions related to Y”) Mentoring someone on a project (“gave Ben advice</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>from time to time on leading his first big project”) Giving an internal talk</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>or workshop</span></span></code></pre><h3 id="design-documentation">Design &amp; documentation</h3>
<p>List design docs &amp; documentation that you worked on</p>
<pre class="giallo" style="color: #EBDBB2; background-color: #32302F;"><code data-lang="plain"><span class="giallo-l"><span>Design docs: I usually just say “wrote design for X” or “reviewed design for</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>X” Documentation: maybe briefly explain the goal behind this documentation</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>(for example “we were getting a lot of questions about X, so I documented it</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>and now we can answer the questions more quickly”)</span></span></code></pre><h3 id="company-building">Company building</h3>
<p>This is a category we have at work – it basically means “things you did to help
the company overall, not just your project / team”. Some things that go in here:</p>
<pre class="giallo" style="color: #EBDBB2; background-color: #32302F;"><code data-lang="plain"><span class="giallo-l"><span>Going above &amp; beyond with interviewing or recruiting (doing campus</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>recruiting, etc) Improving important processes, like the interview process</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>or writing better onboarding materials</span></span></code></pre><h3 id="what-you-learned">What you learned</h3>
<p>My friend Julian suggested this section and I think it’s a great idea – try
listing important things you learned or skills you’ve acquired recently! Some
examples of skills you might be learning or improving:</p>
<pre class="giallo" style="color: #EBDBB2; background-color: #32302F;"><code data-lang="plain"><span class="giallo-l"><span>how to do performance analysis &amp; make code run faster internals of an</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>important piece of software (like the JVM or Postgres or Linux) how to use a</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>library (like React) how to use an important tool (like the command line or</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>Firefox dev tools) about a specific area of programming (like localization</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>or timezones) an area like product management / UX design how to write a</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>clear design doc a new programming language</span></span></code></pre>
<p>It’s really easy to lose track of what skills you’re learning, and usually when
I reflect on this I realize I learned a lot more than I thought and also notice
things that I’m not learning that I wish I was. Outside of work</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It’s also often useful to track accomplishments outside of work, like:</p>
<p>blog posts talks/panels open source work Industry recognition</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think this can be a nice way to highlight how you’re thinking about your
career outside of strictly what you’re doing at work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This can also include other non-career-related things you’re proud of, if that
feels good to you! Some people like to keep a combined personal + work brag
document.</p>
<h3 id="general-prompts">General prompts</h3>
<h3 id="if-you-re-feeling-stuck-for-things-to-mention-try">If you’re feeling stuck for things to mention, try:</h3>
<pre class="giallo" style="color: #EBDBB2; background-color: #32302F;"><code data-lang="plain"><span class="giallo-l"><span>If you were trying to convince a friend to come join your company/team, what</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>would you tell them about your work? Did anybody tell you that you did</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>something well recently?</span></span></code></pre>
