<h4 id="s">S</h4>
<ul>
<li>Add mitigation for optimistic acks</li>
<li>The rfc was clear how to do this (skip packets), but also vague because it didnt mention how many packets to skip and how often.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="t">T</h4>
<ul>
<li>Come up with a strategy for skipping packet and mitigating the attack.</li>
<li>Implement the mitigation in s2n-quic.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="a">A</h4>
<ul>
<li>Audited other QUIC implementations and conducted analysis to answer two key questions:
<ul>
<li>How many packets to skip?</li>
<li>How often should packets be skipped?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There were 2 other implementations that were using a &quot;static&quot; (skipping did not evolve with cwnd)
approach. Their strategy was to:
<ul>
<li>Track skipping 1 pn. Overwrite value when a new pn needs to be skipped.</li>
<li>Skip a random pn in some static range.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The &quot;static&quot; approach was network dependent (DC vs public wifi):
<ul>
<li>Does overriting skip pn nullify the mitigation?</li>
<li>Is a static skip range effective for all networks?
<ul>
<li>A cwnd is very different in a DS vs public internet</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Considered the option of skipping multiple packets:
<ul>
<li>Pro: This would allow us to skip more frequenly</li>
<li>Con: Require storing multiple skip pn. How many pn should we store?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Analyzed the purpose of the mitigation to come up with an optimal solution.
<ul>
<li>The goal of the mitigation was to prevent cwnd bloat.</li>
<li>Which could be done if packets were acked prior to the peer receiving them.</li>
<li>By basing skip range on the number of packets that could be received with an cwnd.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Solution: evolve skip packet range based on cwnd and only store 1 skip pn.</li>
<li>Calculate range based on packets we expect to send in a single period.
<ul>
<li><code>pkt_per_cwnd = cwnd / mtu</code></li>
<li><code>rand = pkt_per_cwnd/2..pkt_per_cwnd*2</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="r">R</h4>
<ul>
<li>Successfully implemented the mitigation.</li>
<li>Only had to store 1 skip pn.</li>
<li>By evolving the skip range based on cwnd, s2n-quic would scale to all networks.</li>

<ul>
<li>Explore the ACK delay RFC and see if s2n-quic could benefit from implementing it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pros of delay:</p>
<ul>
<li>send/recv acks is CPU expensive
<ul>
<li>on the send heavy server it takes 24.33%</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>asymmetric links like satellite</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons of delay:</p>
<ul>
<li>progress: delayed acknowledgment can delay data being sent from peer
<ul>
<li>the RFC lets you adjust thresholds</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ECN: congestion signal by the network
<ul>
<li>ack packets with ECN markings immediately</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>loss recovery: detect a packet was not received and retransmit</li>
<li>cc: regular acks help establish good RTT estimates and drive CC</li>
<li>BBR: requires a high precision signal to work so it was unclear how delaying
acks would affect this</li>
</ul>
<p>RFC features:</p>
<ul>
<li>negotiating the extension: min_ack_delay. the minimum amount of time, that the
endpoint sending this value is willing to delay an acknowledgment</li>
<li>ACK_FREQUENCY frame:
<ul>
<li>Ack-Eliciting Threshold: max ack eliciting <strong>packets</strong> received before sending an ack</li>
<li>Requested Max Ack Delay:  max <strong>time</strong> to wait before sending an ack</li>
<li>Reordering Threshold: max number of <strong>reordered packet</strong> before sending an ack</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>IMMEDIATE_ACK frame: asks peer to send an immediate ack</li>
<li>Expedite ECN: ecn marked packets should not be delayed</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>lessons learned:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>we had to be cautious about delaying acks because we were operating on public
internet</li>
<li>I wonder if an environment like DC would be better for delaying acks</li>
<li>acks are a signal within the noise of loss,delay,congestion,etc</li>
<li>within a DC there is less noise so it makes sense that we can have less signal
and get away with it</li>

<p>Currently s2n-quic does the certificate lookup/loading operations synchronously.</p>
<p>Non ideal for application which server multiple domains concurrently and need to
load multiple certificates, since that would block the thread.</p>
<h4 id="t">T</h4>
<p>Allowed for certificate lookup/loading operations to be performed asynchronously
and enable non-blocking behavior.</p>

<p>s2n-tls:</p>

<li>The work involved converting the callback only-invoked-once to a
poll-the-callback model in s2n-tls.</li>
<li>s2n-tls by default did not allow for poll callbacks.</li>
<li>s2n-tls previously only called the callback once, which not the Rust model
and has quite a few drawbacks.
<ul>
<li>Polling only once means the application/s2n-quic has to schedule (separate
thread possibly) the completion of the callback.</li>
<li>It also needs to manage the state associated with the callback separately.</li>
<li>The Rust polling model allows for all state associated with the future to
live within the object bing polled.</li>
<li>Additionally, the future can make progress as part of the already existing
runtime that s2n-quic starts with.</li>

<p>The previous implementation involved closing the connection by default if the bytes transferred
dropped below some user specified amount.</p>
<h4 id="t">T</h4>
<p>While simple and effective implementation, this seems like an sharp edge and made me uneasy.
The reason for this was:</p>
<ul>
<li>the user specified value could become stale</li>
<li>the default action closing the connection could be an availability risk</li>
<li>in a worse case scenario this could lead to a stampede of closing all connections</li>

<p>I was a technical advisor for SP. They had a business goal which was to choose a contractor to help them build a website, and back and also conduct some user surveys.</p>
<h4 id="t">T</h4>
<p>I started the process by first identifying the overall architecture of the applicaiton. The second step was to find a second contractor and then interview both based on their technical expertise.</p>
<h4 id="a">A</h4>
<p>After speaking with both and reviewing the technical spec I was of the opinion that the original contractor did not have the technical expertise however they did have the best business insight.</p>
<p>I recommended that there was a high risk of technical debt and that we seek out the second contractor.</p>
<p>In the end my client decided to go with the first contractor. Their primary concern was to reduce the number of parties involved and since the first contractor was someone they were familiar with they choose the more expensive and less technically stable option.</p>
<h4 id="r">R</h4>
<p>Once the decision was made I supported the decision. The primarily goal was to move forward and do everything in our power to allow the first contractor to succeed.</p>
<p>Recently my gut feeling has proven correct, in that the contractor is not very flexible technically or process wise and very expensive.</p>

<p>Realized that our recs were being incorrectly cached. The reason for this was
the historic configuration of specifying the blacklisted paths.</p>
<h4 id="t">T</h4>
<p>The inital fix for the recs service was an easy config change. However to avoid
such a mistake in the future I proposed that we should change from blacklist to
whitelist.</p>
<h4 id="a">A</h4>
<p>Initially this seems like a very risky manuver, expecially when changing this for
live production traffic. Therefore I took a few precautions to eliminate the risk.</p>
<p>Used randomint() VCL function to distribute the traffic.</p>
<p>I decided the a % based rollout, and then progressed to do it over 3 weeks.</p>
<h4 id="r">R</h4>
<p>At each 10% increase I gained additional confidence, about the new configs. Watching
the cache hit ratio (89%), the traffic pattern also remained the same. Additionally,
by communicating with the rest of my team as well as being aware of other company
events, I was able to aviod being suspect of any failures by mistake.</p>
<p>The result was a clean migration, a more resilient system and probably a higher
morale since there were no outages.</p>

<h4 id="s">S</h4>
<p>I was on call got a page at approx 10pm. There was a rabbitMq that had
backlogged and was alerting. The first hurdle was that there was no
login/password information about how to access the queue and see what was going
on.</p>
<h4 id="t">T</h4>
<p>I tried to reach the secondary in the hopes of gathering more information but
to no avail. I tried the tertiary(boss) and also the primary on the ingestion
team but received no answer.</p>
<p>My task at this point became deciding how to proceed.</p>
<h4 id="a">A</h4>
<p>I was able to get login information from the SRE oncall and able to inspect the
queue. At this point I saw that a message was causing a backlog so I cleared it
manually.</p>
<p>Once the queue started draining I silenced the specific alarm and went about
the night. However the error happened again and I noticed that there was
another message now causing the backlog.</p>
<p>It became apparent that manually skipping the error message was not a solution.
There were approx 10k messages queued, which was the limit of the queue but I
suspected that if the backlog continued it could fill up the drives causing
more damage.</p>
<h4 id="r">R</h4>
<p>It was also apparent that the batch job was not correct, in the sense that it
was unable to handle all message types, which was resulting in the backlog. I
therefore decided to cancel the batch job and drain the queue.</p>
<p>Since it was a batch job and it was being developed (not customer facing),
there was little harm in stopping the alert and job, which could be looked at
in the morning.</p>

<h4 id="s">S</h4>
<p>This was during a hack week project and the goal of our 3 person team was to
help automate QA-testing done for apps at the company.</p>
<p>The current way to do testing was to open the app, in a simulator and use
charles proxy to collect http traffic logs. The logs would then be parsed
manually.</p>
<p>This could take entire days and sometimes resulted in incomplete testing if
an urgent release was scheduled. It also meant long hours and sometimes
weekend work for the QA team.</p>
<p>The team was composed of a non-technical QA member, an iOS dev and myself (backend).</p>
<h4 id="t">T</h4>
<p>The initial goal was to use a UI testing framework for iOS and therefore automate
the collection and then verification of the tests. We spent 1.5 days trying
to get the UI framework to work, however it was unpredictable on different computers
and eventually just didnt work.</p>
<h4 id="a">A</h4>
<p>Realizing that we were at risk of not having any product I decided to take a step
back and see if we could produce something useful.</p>
<p>I took half the day to create a simple POC; to tackle the testing and not the data
gathering portion.</p>
<p>This was a much simpler and predictable problem to solve. The log data could be ingested
as Json and a series of tests could be run on it. Java was chosen since it was a
language most people would be comfortable with, it was typed and the non-technical
QA memebers could augment it.</p>
<p>We created a somewhat abstract testing framework. It had 3 broad scopes: ingest data from file,
filter data based on test to be run (user id, header), verify data based on custom test rules.</p>
<p>At some point I devoted majority of my time to training and guiding the QA member on
understanding and augmenting to the codebase. Transfering owenership to the QA team
was an important goal for me if the project was to succeed.</p>
<h4 id="r">R</h4>
<p>We were also tackle time sensitive and manually arduous tests (token refresh every 5min).
By the end of the week we were able to execute 6 different tests, implement
2 different testing scenarios (find a value, stateful testing).</p>
<p>Needless to say the QA team was very happy and with the testing abstraction in place they
were then able to implement more tests themselves.</p>

<li>should have consulted seniors more (get buy in)</li>
<li>should have demonstrated small example rather go for the cake</li>

<h4 id="s">S</h4>
<p>instead of updating configs across multiple envs and regions (qa, stg, us, au, nz) I wanted to create a template that would allow us to update the value in a single file. The remaining content could then be defined once.</p>

<p>Once the implementation had was done and the team clearly supported the other implementatino, I made it a point to verbally commend it in a meeting and show support.</p>

<p>I wanted to get involved in the OSS community, learn and give back. To force myself to do this I got involved during the impl days and claimed a feature that offered mentorship.</p>
<h4 id="t">T</h4>
<p>Understand the codebase. Understand the context around the feature. Understand the feature. Learn to work with the codebase. Commit a PR to implement the feature.</p>
<h4 id="a">A</h4>
<p>Learned to build and work in a large codebase. Took 7 months but from the moment I asked to work on the feature I knew that I had to finish it.</p>
<h4 id="r">R</h4>
<p>Added feature to infer predicates and thus made a small contibution to the ergonomics of the langugage.
Added docs for the feature.</p>

<p>Others bailed when it came time to actually put in time and organize the meetup. The tasks were no very rewarding and involved coordinating with companies, and speakers and trying to get sponsors.</p>

<p>I decided to take charge and try and build a sustainable community.</p>
<h4 id="a">A</h4>
<p>I created a list of companies.
I spoke to attendees and convinced a few to speak or otherwise host.
I invited everyone to speak on their side projects.
I organized a un-meetup and volunteered to teach the begineer session.</p>
<h4 id="r">R</h4>
<p>I was able to organize a meetup each month for approx 1.5 years before transitioning it to a co-organizer. We had average 30 people attending per meetup with upwards of 60 at a few events. We had a home for the meetup where we could each month and a sponsor who would provide food and drinks. There were approx 10 consistent member who would show up very often and would help carry it forward.</p>
