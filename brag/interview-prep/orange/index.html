</ul>
<h4 id="rfc">RFC:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Acks uses:
<ul>
<li>progress: acknowledge packet received</li>
<li>loss recovery: detect a packet was not received and retransmit</li>
<li>cc: regular acks help establish good RTT estimates and drive CC</li>
<li>ECN: congestion signal by the network</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>ACK Frame {
  Type (i) = 0x02..0x03,
  Largest Acknowledged (i),
  ACK Delay (i),
  ACK Range Count (i),
  First ACK Range (i),
  ACK Range (..) ...,
  [ECN Counts (..)],
}
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>motivation: expensive cpu to send/recv. asymmetric links like satellite. ack
rate can affect link efficiency.</li>
<li>negotiating the extension: min_ack_delay. the minimum amount of time, in
microseconds, that the endpoint sending this value is willing to delay an
acknowledgment</li>
<li>ACK_FREQUENCY frame:
<ul>
<li>Ack-Eliciting Threshold: max ack eliciting <strong>packets</strong> received before sending an ack</li>
<li>Requested Max Ack Delay:  max <strong>time</strong> to wait before sending an ack</li>
<li>Reordering Threshold: max number of <strong>reordered packet</strong> before sending an ack</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>IMMEDIATE_ACK frame: asks peer to send an immediate ack</li>
<li>Expedite ECN: ecn marked packets should not be delayed</li>
<li>other concerns:
<ul>
<li>congestion control:</li>
<li>application limited:</li>
<li>burst mitigation: if sending is dependent on recieving acks. use pacing</li>
<li>loss detection is hard: RFC doesnt provide a good solution</li>
<li>connecion migration: send IMMEDIATE_ACK to expedite path validation. ack
frequency is NOT reset!! on new path.. but should be update to the new path</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>TOP</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A design choice that encured technical debt but you think it was a good choice.</li>
<li>Tell me about a time you worked well within a team.
<ul>
<li>Helped co-worker in CLOUDFRONT integrate with async cert loading feature.</li>
<li>helped deliver quic over 2 years. specifically worked in a team of three to review prs, make design
decisions etc.</li>
<li>connection migration pentest</li>
<li>orchestrator. i implemented the library logic and he helped me with the automated infra</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tell me about a time you dealt with conflict on a team. How did you solve it?
<ul>
<li>prioritize features for the orchestrator. we met with the stake holder and figured out which
features they actually wanted to help prioritize the project</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>How do you respond when you disagree with a coworker?
<ul>
<li>disagrements usually stem form mis-matched assumptions or lack of
communication. so i like to start with having a conversation and
trying to understand why there is a disagreemet. usually when this
happens we both end up learning something.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tell me about a time you failed at work.
<ul>
<li>ack frequency project. the cpu usage went up after implementing the solution</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can you give me an example of how you set goals for yourself?
<ul>
<li>daily task list. mark what got done and what did not</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Tell me about a time you showed leadership.</strong>
<ul>
<li>spoke up about technical decisions that I spoke out on</li>
<li>representing someone external to yourself
<ul>
<li>took initiative to fix handshake status. added fuzz testing verify the solution.</li>
<li>automate release versioning</li>
<li>customer contact list</li>

<p><strong>LOW</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What is the most helpful feedback you've ever gotten?</li>
<li>As a software engineer, you must be both predictable and innovative. How can these traits coexist
in your work?</li>
<li>Tell me about a time you adapted to a new situation or environment.</li>
<li>Tell me about a time you needed information from someone who wasn't responsive. How did you
handle it?</li>

<blockquote>
<p>https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-2024-annual-founders-letter/</p>
<p>One of the most common questions we’re asked is how we plan to preserve Cloudflare's culture? Our
answer is always the same: the goal isn't how to preserve our culture, it's always how to improve
it.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>It seems to me that CLOUDFLARE is in a crowded market space (cdn/securing the internet (fastly),
paas (aws), data security (crowdstrike)). What do you believe is your single biggest technical or
non-technical advantage that will make you successful over your competitors?</li>
<li>What is the top kpi/metric you personally pay attention to, to make sure CLOUDFLARE is maintaining
its momentum?</li>
<li>What is the most imporant thing CLOUDFLARE does to build high-functioning and talented teams?</li>
<li>AWS's customers dislike that there are over 200 services.
<ul>
<li>In one of you blog posts [1] you mentioned:</li>
<li>&quot;we believe our continued success should be primarily driven by new innovation, not by milking
old features for revenue.&quot;</li>
<li>How will you preserve a seamless user experience as you continue to launch new features?</li>
</ul>
</li>
