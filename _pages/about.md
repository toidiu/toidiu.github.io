Minimal Mistakes is a flexible two-column Jekyll theme. Perfect for hosting your personal site, blog, or portfolio on GitHub or self-hosting on your own server. As the name implies --- styling is purposely minimalistic to be enhanced and customized by you :smile:.

The theme includes responsive layouts (`single`, `archive`, and `splash` pages) that look great on mobile and desktop browsers.
