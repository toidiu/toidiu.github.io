getting\nstarted. This is the third time in 3 years that I have set out to learn something new and\nbecome proficient, so I wanted to share my experience on how I learned Scala and built\nSubwayTunes.\nThe code if now available on github.\nCheatsheet\nSome of the technology behind SubwayTunes includes the Play Framework, ReactiveMongo,\nDocker, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS S3.\nHere is a list of resources I used to help me learn Scala and Play Framework in no\nparticular order:\nScala for the Impatient for basic Scala\nsyntax.\nFunctional Programming in\nScala and the\naccompanying solutions. A great book that uses\nexercises to re-enforce concepts in Scala. I recommend reading as much of this book as\npossible and attempting the exercises yourself first.\nEbook - amazingly through and yet\nconcise. Great reference for all levels.\nLook at other's\ncode\ndon't worry about all the setup and just git clone and use activator run to\nlaunch.\nCoursera class taught by the master. Coursera\nclasses are not for me but the course offers great sources and I do recommend it.\nNYC Scala Meetup\nWhy?\nOnce a doctor graduates from Medical school, he or she has the responsibility to stay up\nto date with new developments in the field, by reading publications and attending\nconferences. Similarly, as software engineers, I believe it is our responsibility to stay\ncurrent with new technology and best practices. You wouldn't build a Flash app for a\nwebsite, would you?\nIdea\nWhen attempting to learn a new technology, the biggest barrier you will face is\nfrustration and becoming overwhelmed. For this reason, it is important to supplement your\ntechnical learning with practical application. Doing so will allow you to switch contexts\nif one task becomes too tedious and help mitigate your frustration.\nIn my experience, having a tangible project is critical for successful follow-through.\nBetter yet, choose an idea that is relevant to your daily life or your interests. Maybe\nyou hate waking up in the morning...so make an alarm app.\nPlay\nSpend some time setting up your environment and then write some code. There are plenty of\nresources to help you get started and write something more significant than a \"Hello\nWorld!\". Find a sample project on Github and get it to build. Then start tinkering with\nit.\nThe idea behind starting with a sample is to see a finished product in action and whet\nyour appetite. You may not be able to accomplish much else, but thats ok.\nMeet\nImagine wanting to be a chef and having Alton Brown show you how to perfect a recipe that\nhe tried last week. That is the power of a good Meetup: being able to speak with some of\nthe top professionals in the industry. Not only are you exposing yourself to the\nopportunity to network but also absorbing the jargon and best practices relevant to your\nproject.\nThe biggest risk of attempting to learn something by yourself, is to waste time learning\nthe wrong thing or just figuring out what to learn in the first place. A book can be a\ngreat resource, but it can quickly become outdated, especially in the field of software.\nMy advice is to attend a few Meetups on the topic and see if one or two stand out. Then\nattend regularly for some time. I find myself feeling more motivated each time I attend a\nMeetup.\nAsk\nWhen at a Meetup, don't simply go for the organized talks. Ask people for recommendations\non relevant books, tutorials, videos, conferences, and even other Meetups. Chances are,\nthe people you meet have been in the same position as you are and can help you save weeks\nof guessing. Remember, you want to avoid wasting time as much as possible.\nRepeat\nExpect to get stuck. It takes years to be an expert at any technology. The goal is not to\nbe perfect, but to keep stepping forward. You are bound to stumble across the finish like\neventually! Switch between expanding your technical knowledge and project implementation.\nAfter gaining the preliminary knowledge, try your best to break your learning into\ndiscrete steps so that each new step helps you accomplish a piece of your project.\nYou might find yourself getting frustrated trying to achieve perfect implementation. Stop\nyourself. Just write something that works. I guarantee that regardless of what you write,\nit will change 2-3 times before the end of the project anyway.","id":"https://toidiu.com/blog/2016-05-15-learning-scala/","title":"Learning Scala"},"https://toidiu.com/blog/2016-08-12-android-low-memory-testing/":{"body":"Resource constraints is what separate mobile development from other types of development.\nThis post focuses on \"low memory\" constraints and to test for this ephemeral state.\nOut of sight, out of mind\nIt is often easy to ignore a problem that is unlikely to occur.

In terms of OOP, this mean\nthat a class can have many different forms and behave in different manners depending on\nthe context. Scala has 3 types of Polymorphism that we will explore further below.\nSubtype Polymorphism\nParametric Polymorphism\nAd-hoc Polymorphism\nThe Scala compiler evaluates subtype at Runtime while parametric and ad-hoc are evaluated\nat compile time.\nI have found that I learn much better when I have to write about it and explain it to\nothers. This is an exercise for my understanding but hopefully it will also help others.\nThe accompanying code for this post can be found on\ngithub.\nSubtype Polymorphism\nIn Java we have subtype polymorphism and this is the one that most people learn about.\nThis is when we define a super/parent class or interface(traits in Scala) and then extend\nthis behavior in a child class. In the example below, we can think of Taco as a sub-type\nof the type Food.\nAs seen from the example above, both Taco and Cereal are child classes that extend the\nbehavior of trait Food.\nWe can now substitute instances of Taco for a value that requires Food. A way to think\nabout this is that by extending the class Food, Taco essentially guarantees that it will\nfulfill a contract and define the values isEdible and minToPrep; and therefore makes a\nperfectly acceptable substitute for Food.\nIn this case we define the value for isEdible as true for all foods. However, the name and\nminToPrep value is customized based on the different types of food.\nAs a note, sub-type polymorphism is determined at Runtime. The type of the class is looked\nup at Runtime and then the appropriate method is called. For more information about this\nread the Wikipedia article on Dynamic\nDispatch.\nParametric Polymorphism\nIn Java the name for parametric polymorphism is 'Generics'. The idea is to create data\nstructures and write code that can be generic or type agnostic. A good example to\ndemonstrate this is List. Below we construct a List for holding Int which doesn't use\nparametric polymorphism.\nThe above code is fine if we only want to create a list of Int but we quickly run into\nproblems when we want to create a list of String, Long, Taco!! We now have to re-write the\nsame code and create multiple copies for each data type.\nThis violates the DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself) principle of good\nprogramming. To understand the reason behind DRY, just consider\nwhat happens if we want to now add a method to append lists\ntogether. We would have to add the same code to the implementation\nfor each type of List.\nInstead we could re-write List data structure using parametric polymorphism, in a more\ngeneric manner(pun intended :P).\nThe + sign on the definition of the List declares List structure\nas covariant. This means that if we declare a list of Food\nval list = List[Food] we can add Taco and Cereal to the list.\nThe advantages are obvious... we can define the List data structure once and utilize it\nwith any type of object!\nAd-hoc Polymorphism\nLet me admit, this one was confusing for me. Therefore I will first explain the concept in\nplain english to get a general understanding. I will then demonstrate the concept with\ncode and relate it back to the english definition.\nWikipedia defines ad-hoc polymorphism\nas follows:\nAd hoc polymorphism is a kind of polymorphism in which\npolymorphic [1]functions can be applied to arguments of\ndifferent types, because a polymorphic function can\n[2]denote a number of distinct and potentially heterogeneous\nimplementations [3]depending on the type of argument(s)\nto which it is applied. It is also known as function\noverloading or operator overloading... This is in [4]contrast\nto parametric polymorphism, in which polymorphic functions\nare written without mention of any specific type, and can\nthus apply a single abstract implementation to any number of\ntypes in a transparent way.\nAn ad-hoc polymorphic function can take different types of arguments. ex. Int or\nString.\nThe implementation of the ad-hoc polymorphic function function can vary.\nCombining points 1 and 2, the implementation of the function will vary depending on the\ntype of the argument passed to the function.\nThats really it! Another way to think about this is that we are doing function\noverloading and the function does different things based on the type we pass it.\nThe statement helps us to differentiate ad-hoc from parametric polymorphism. Remember\nfrom before, in parametric polymorphism the implementation of the function(List\nconstructor) was the same regardless of the type passed in.\nSome code:\nWe first define a Texture trait and a function that prints the Texture. Note:\nprintTexture is our ad-hoc polymorphic function. printTexture takes a type parameter\nt: T and a texture implementation of that type o: Texture[T].\nAhh ha.. from bullet (1), the function takes different types as arguments.\nIgnore the implicit keyword for now. I will how this is later used\nto automatically pull in the correct implementation of Texture.\nNext we need to define the different implementation depending on the the class type. Note\nhow in the Texture object we define TacoTexture and WetTacoTexture which define the\ntexture for the class Taco that we defined above.\nWe also define a new class called Silk which can also have a texture and give it a\ntexture implementation SilkTexture.\nAhh ha.. from bullet (2), we have varying definitions based on the types.\nAgain notice but ignore the implicit keyword. We will make the\nconnection later.\nWe can now create instances of Taco and Silk and pass them to our ad-hoc polymorphic\nfunction printTexture. The function, depending on the type prints the appropriate\ntexture!\nNow you might be asking how did printTexture get the appropriate implementation for\nTexture? The answer is implicits; we import the implicits with the statement import Texture._ and the Scala compiler takes care of the rest. Note, however that we can always\nprovide the Texture[T] explicitly and get the desired implementation.\nI should also mention that we can only have one type of\nimplicit definition in the same scope because otherwise the\nScala compiler get mad. ex. We don't declare WetTacoTexture as\nan implicit.\nAhh ha.. we demonstrate bullet (3), the function implementation varies depending on the\ntype!!\nDifferent Syntax:\nLet's look at another way we can write our ad-hoc polymorphism function. The Scala\ncompiler provides syntactical sugar so that we can re-write the function as follows. So\ndon't get confused when you see either representation.\nAddendum\nThanks to Wil Lee for clarifying this and highlighting the power of Ad-hoc\npolymorphism.\nYou might have noticed something cool about ad-hoc polymorphism; at no point did we modify\nthe class Food and yet we were able to give it a Texture! Ad-hoc polymorphism allows\nus to extend the functionality of a piece of code, even if we don't have access to the\nsource (library, legacy code).\nAnd to quote Wil, who explains it eloquently:\nWith Java interfaces / Scala traits, you can't claim that some type implements such an\ninterface unless you have access to that type's source code and can modify it. With\nad-hoc polymorphism, you don't need to be able change the type's source code. Using your\npost's example, Taco and Silk can come from some 3rd party library, and due to the\nimplicit pattern you can still define a Texture for them.","id":"https://toidiu.com/blog/2016-10-31-polymorphism-in-scala/","title":"Polymorphism in Scala"},"https://toidiu.com/blog/2017-05-27-a-practical-guide-to-breakout/":{"body":"In this post I will be reviewing scala.collection.breakOut from an application\ndeveloper's perspective rather than a functional programming enthusiast.

I wanted to try for myself and see the amount of effort needed to get a lambda function working, while also diving deeper into whats involved.\nThis blog post describes how to use the lambda runtime to create a lambda function in Rust, so I wont detail the actual process. Instead I will try to expand on what is actually happening behind the scenes and reasons for certain steps.\nHere is some code that creates and invokes a lambda function.\nWhy we need \"[[bin]] bootstrap\" and \"autobins = false\"\nSince we are going to include a custom runtime(tokio runtime), we need the executable to be called 'bootstrap'. These settings allow us to dictate these settings.\nWhat is \"glibc\" and \"musl\" and whats the difference\nThis is a much larger topic but I will try to cover the relevant pieces. A computer comprises of layers of abstractions. So for example, if we wish to execute a task in our application, we request a thread from the kernel, which schedules our task to run on a core.\nSo to access resources of a computer we need to communicate with the kernel. The kernel in turn exposes the API via a C standard called the libc. glibc (GNU C Library) and musl are two different implementations of this standard.\nglibc is the most commonly supported libc but Amazon instances require musl. From it's site: musl is lightweight, fast, simple, free, and strives to be correct in the sense of standards-conformance and safety.\nstatic vs dynamic lib\nI was not able to figure out if the musl lib is statically or dynamically linked. If I had to guess, I would say it is dynamically linked so as not to bloat the size of our lambda function. Additionally, since all functions should be targeting musl, it doesn't make sense to include it with each function.\nwhat is a lambda runtime?\nThe lambda! macro takes an optional field: tokio runtime. As per docs creating a runtime does the following:\nSpawn a background thread running a Reactor instance.\nStart a ThreadPool for executing futures.\nRun an instance of Timer per thread pool worker thread.\nOne can imagine configuring a runtime to specify the number of threads. Configuration options for the tokio runtime can be found in docs\nBtw, as per AWS docs there is a default limit of 1024 threads/processes per function.\nWhy we need target.x86_64-unknown-linux-musl\nThe amazon linux instances require musl. For reference here is a list of all the target that the Rust compiler supports!\nWhy we need linker = \"x86_64-linux-musl-gcc\"\nWe need to download the linker so that we can locally compile for the musl target.\nConclusion\nThe smart folks at AWS have done a lot to make developing for lambda easy. However, it is always nice to understand where and how our code is actually running... yes, event in the world of lambda. In a future post I hope to explore firecracker, the micro-vm(yup written in Rust) where all lambda functions run.\nReferences:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmasterrace/comments/41q2m9/eli5_what_is_musl_and_glibc/cz4cy3k","id":"https://toidiu.com/blog/2018-12-24-understanding-lambda-in-rust/","title":"Understanding Lambda in Rust"},"https://toidiu.com/blog/2019-02-19-db-testing-in-rust/":{"body":"Writing integration tests for databases is often a cryptic art.

So within a single thread a task might run until it makes an\nasync non-blocking call (file read, network send, timeout, etc.).\nThe non-blocking is important because it allows the runtime to utilize the thread to run\nanother task instead (ie. the network call is waiting for some packets to arrive and\ndoesn't actually need cpu resources). This cooperative non-blocking scheduling by the\nexecutor allows for much denser workloads to occur compared to the thread per task model.\nIn this cooperative scheduling, a task (as it is known in tokio) is the unit of work\n(rather than a thread). A task should contains all the information to start, make progress\nand finish the work. Being asynchronous, a task expects Future, which it can start, and\nthen poll() to completion.\nPoll: the result returned from calling poll on a Future.

We will start by looking at a real ASN.1\nobject before diving into the theory. Finally, we will tie it back to \"real\" world\ncryptography by seeing how these concepts are used in engineering.\nPractical\nWe start by inspecting the ASN.1 object representation of the certificate of this\nwebsite\n(i.e. the certificate for this website can be represented as a ASN.1 object). Notice how\nthe ASN.1 object is similar to struct and contains a bunch of different fields pertaining\nto the RFC 5280. See if you can find:\nThe Subject which should be\n\"toidiu.com\".\nThe Issuer which should be the\nintermediate (\"WE1\") and root (\"Google Trust Services\") certificates.\nThe Subject Public Key Info\nassociated with the certificate (search for \"subjectPublicKeyInfo\" and\n\"subjectPublicKey\"). This is the public key associated with the site \"toidiu.com\"\nThe signatureAlgorithm (search\n\"signatureAlgorithm\"). Notice that signatureAlgorithm is different from the \"Subject\nPublic Key Info\" above. signatureAlgorithm is CA's (Certificate Authority) signature\ncomputed on the contents of this certificate. The \"signature\" is what helps us verify\nthat the CA actually issued the certificate for \"toidiu.com\".\nTheory\nFor a detailed dive into ASN.1, I highly recommend reading the post Warm Welcome to ASN.1\nand DER. ASN.1 is an\ninterface definition language\n(IDL). An IDL needs to be\nable to do 2 things:\ndefining data structures (e.g. define structure of a certificate)\nserialization and deserialization of those data structures (e.g. convert struct to\nbytes and back)\nThe advantage of writing ASN.1 definitions instead of Go or C definitions is that they are\nlanguage-independent.\nWhile it is possible to represent a certificate in your application language (e.g. Rust),\nthe ASN.1 representation is language agnostic and can be used across multiple languages\n(ASN.1 parser implementations are available for multiple languages). I like to use the\nanalogy of Java, which allows you to \"write code once, run anywhere\". Similarly, ANS.1\nallows your to \"define/serialize an object in one application and deserialize/reconstruct\nin any other application\".\nThere are some other languages that do the same things as ASN.1. For instance, Protocol\nBuffers offer both a language for defining types and a serialization format for encoding\nobjects of the types you’ve defined... but ASN.1 (1984) had the significant advantage of\nalready existing when certificates (1988) and HTTPS (1994) were invented.\nASN.1, while not perfect (a ASN.1 parser is complicated to implement), has become the\nstandard in cryptography.\n\"Real\" world usage\nNow that we have an understanding of what ASN.1 objects are, lets see how we can make use\nof it in real engineering applications. TLS, PKI, and VPNs are just a few examples where\nthese concepts apply.\nIn the following code snippet we are representing a private key as ASN.1 and then encode\nit as der/pem. In real cryptography we often have to do similar operations on other secret\nmaterial such as public key, certificates, etc.\nprivate_key: private key generate perhaps from a key exchange\nbig_num_key: generate a bignum\nfrom the private key\ncreate a PKCS #8 encoded ASN.1 object: asn1_obj\nASN.1: a language for defining data structure.\nIn cryptography, we care about a few encodings:\nPKCS #1: format for encoding and decoding RSA private and public keys\nPKCS #8: format for encoding cryptographic private keys, often containing pairs of\nprivate and public keys. Can encode multiple key types (RSA, ECDSA, etc) and\nshould be preferred over PKCS #1.\nX.509: format for encoding digital certificates\nder is just the raw bytes of the ans1 object\npem is the base64 representation of the der bytes\nI hope this example illustrates how a \"private key\" ends up into a \"priv.pem\" file that\nyou often see in cryptographic contexts. The \"priv.pem\" file could then be given\nto your application, and the application can then reconstuct the key and use it\nto securely communicate with a database.\nConclusion\nIn engineering applications we care about taking some secret material (key, certificate)\nand serializing it so that we can then share (via network, file, memory) it with our peer.\nASN.1 is the common format that cryptographic implementations have agreed upon. We looked\nat PKCS #1 and PKCS #8 which are optional of ASN.1 formats used primarily for storing key\nmaterial (there are many other PKCS formats for different contexts).

More formally it aim to\nprovide 3 security properties:\nAuthentication: is the peer who they say they are.\nConfidentiality: messages between two peers are secret and only visible to the peers\nIntegrity: messages sent to peers are tamper proof. A tampered message can be detected.\nBut how exactly does TLS enforce these properties?\nAuthentication\nIn TLS authentication is satisfied by the use of certificates. A server sends its\ncertificate during the handshake. The client will optionally send its certificate if the\nserver requests mutual authentication (aka. mutual TLS or mTLS).\nTrusting a certificate is complicated and typically involves parsing a certificate chain\n(root-cert =&gt; intermediate-cert =&gt; peer-cert). Trust is established if the server trusts\none of the certificates in the chain. RFC\n5280 defines the modern day certificate\ninfrastructure known as x.509 PKI (Public Key Infrastructure). Modern web browsers come\ninstalled with well-established root certificates (Cloudflare root, Mozilla root, etc)\nwhich helps facilitate the internet.\nThe certificate contains the server's public key pair and can be used to verify\nsignatures created by the server.\nSignatures are used by the TLS handshake to ensure that browser is speaking with the \"real\"\npeer (toidiu.com) and not an attacker. This works since only the real \"toidiu.com\" website\nserver will have the private key associated with the public key on the certificate.\nConfidentiality\nConfidentiality is achieved via encryption and its usually what most people think of when\nthey think of \"security\". However, Confidentiality without Authentication (are you sure\nyou are talking with your Bank?) or Integrity (are you really sure that some hacker didn't\nintercept and modify the message?) is not comprehensive security!\nPeers using TLS, exchange a shared secret key, which they use to encrypt messages they\nsend to each other. The exchange of secret material is called a key exchange (kex) and is\npart of a TLS Handshake. There are many kex algorithms (RSA, DHE, EDHE). TLS 1.3 has\ndeprecated many old cipher suites in preference for modern ones.\nECDHE (elliptic\ncurve diffie-hellman ephemeral) makes a fine choice because of additional security\nproperties (forward-secret) and\nperformance compared with other algotithms.\nTo ensure a secure exchange, the TLS 1.3 kex samples key material (kem) from both the\nclient and server when deriving the master secret key (client-public-kem + server-public-kem =&gt; master-secret-key).\nIntegrity\nMAC (message authentication\ncode) is a cryptographic primitive that can be used to check the integrity of a piece of\ndata. During the TLS handshake both peers agree upon a \"secret key\", which is then used to\ngenerate MACs for messages exchanged.\nVery similar to a digital signature, the MAC can be used to verify that the message was in\nfact sent by the peer and not tampered with, i.e. Integrity. Check out this stackover post\nfor the difference between digital signature vs\nMAC.\nIn previous TLS protocols, the MAC was calculated separately. In TLS 1.3, only\nAEAD cipher suites are supported\nso MAC and encryption happen together.\nSub protocols\nThe TLS protocol is divided into two sub protocols: Handshake and Record.\nHandshake protocol\nThe Handshake protocol is responsible for performing a key exchange with the\npeer.

Thus, modifying the data\nthrough one name implicitly modifies the values associated with all aliased names, which\nmay not be expected by the programmer. As a result, aliasing makes it particularly\ndifficult to understand, analyze and optimize programs.\nA mental model for thinking about guarantees that Rust provides is that it makes it easy\nto reason about aliasing. At the end\nof the day it comes down to where is your data, who owns it and who is accessing it. The\nBorrow Checker provides abstractions which allows the Rust compiler to track and reason\nabout these aliasing rules and prevent misuse.\nUnlike C, Rust attempts to automatically track if some data is being referenced, or read\nor written to or already cleaned up. By tracking this automatically, it is able to prevent\ncommon pitfalls we run into in C and also able to make performance optimizations that\nwould be very risky to do when tracking aliasing manually.\nThe following post describes some core Rust primitives that Rust provides to help us\nreason about aliasing.\nOwnership:\nRust has a concept of ownership which assigns \"ownership\" of data to a variable. Since\nownership is exclusive, the Rust compiler is able to reason about when data is valid vs\nwhen it has been freed. Ownership can be transferred, but that still maintains the\nexclusive ownership rule.\nOwnership rules allows the Rust compiler to:\nprevent double free\nprevent accessing memory after free\nwhich ensures memory safety\nBorrowing:\nSince each piece of data has an exclusive owner, borrowing is the mechanism that allows\nfor multiple functions to interact with some data. Multiple reads (&amp; which is an\nimmutable reference) or a single write (&amp;mut mutable reference) are allowed and enforced\nby the Rust compiler.\nBorrowing rules allows the Rust compiler to:\nprevent aliasing\nprevent data races\nwhich ensures single writer or multiple reads\nLifetimes:\nIn C, while it is possible to hand out references to data its also necessary to enforce\nthat the underlying data is valid for as long as the reference is in use. For example, it\nwould be undefined behavior if we were to hand out a reference to some data, and free the\ndata (dangling pointer). Accessing the data after free is undefined behavior and\nconsidered catastrophic.\nTracking a single piece of data and its reference might seem feasible but quickly an\noperational risk as the program grows in complexity.\nLifetime rules allows the Rust compiler to:\nprevent invalid or dangling references\nwhich ensures that references remain valid\nwhich ensures references don't outlive the data they point to\nMemory Aliasing modules\nTo help us deal with aliasing rules Rust provides some containers that a allow us to\nsafely alias memory while also allowing the compiler to reason about them.\nmod cell provides shared mutability\nmod rc provides shared ownership\nmod sync provides synchronization\nShared ownership\nIn the Ownership section we discussed how the Rust compiler enforces exclusive ownership\nof data. The Rust compiler enforces these rules at compile-time, but sometimes there is a\nneed to relax these rules to runtime. The\nrc module doesn't eliminate the rules,\nbut instead \"shifts\" them to runtime.\nRc\nRc allows us to shift how the Ownership\nand Lifetime rules are enforced. Let see how Rc achieves the same guarantees provided by\nOwnership and Lifetime:\nOwnership:\nprevent double free\nprevent accessing memory after free\nLifetime:\nprevent invalid or dangling references\nRc allocates data on the heap (by default Rust allocates on the stack) and then tracking\nthe number of access via a 'non-atomic' (single threaded) reference count. Each access,\nRc::clone(), increments the reference count and each drop() decrements the count . If\nthe count reaches '0', there are no outstanding references to the data and we can free it\n(1. prevents double free). Once the last reference is dropped, its impossible to\ncreate new references (2. prevents accessing memory after free). Together, the logic\nbehind Rc helps ensure that references are valid (3. prevents invalid or dangling\nreferences).\nHere is a Rust playground\nlink\nwhich demonstrate some of these concepts.\nI haven't covered Weak which is\nnecessary when creating for creating cyclical structures using Rc but requires more user\nvigilance to use correctly.\nShared mutability\nSimilar to how the Shared ownership module, rc, shifts the Ownership/Lifetime rules to\nruntime, the Shared mutability module\ncell, \"shifts\" Borrowing guarantees\nfrom compile-time to runtime. Let list these guarantees so we can compare their runtime\nequivalent.\nBorrowing:\nprevent aliasing\nprevent data races\nCell\nCell offers us interior mutability\nby copying (Cell::get()) or moving (Cell::take() and Cell::replace()) the interior\nvalue. By copying/moving the data, Cell ensures that there is only ever a single source of\ndata. This simplistic yet effective data model helps ensure memory safety (1. prevent\naliasing. 2. prevent data races).\nHere is a Rust playground\nlink\nwhich demonstrates some of Cell's APIs.\nRefCell\nInstead of copying/moving values,\nRefCell achieves interior\nmutability by enforcing exclusive mutable access by runtime \"dynamic borrowing\".\nUsing RefCell, its possible to try_borrow() to get a &amp;T or try_borrow_mut() to get a\n&amp;mut T. Underneath RefCell enforces memory safety (1. prevent aliasing. 2.\nprevent data races). Less safe version of these APIs which panic on violation are also\navailable but those seem risky for production use (borrow() and borrow_mut()).\nList of mutable APIs:\nRefCell::borrow_mut()\nRefCell::replace()\nRefCell::swap()\nHere is a Rust playground\nlink\nwhich demonstrates some of RefCell's APIs.\nSynchronization\nSynchronization is useful when a program is operating with multiple threads and wishes to\nshare data across those threads. Shared mutation across threads requires primitives (i.e.\natomics or locks) to enforce exclusive ownership and usage guarantees.\nThe sync module provides these\nsynchronization primitives and has decent explanation which I recommend reading.\nArc\nArc provides us with shared\nownership across threads while enforcing Rust's Ownership/Lifetime rules. This is similar\nto Rc, except Rc is not thread-safe (Arc stands for Atomic Reference Counted or\nAtomic-Rc).\nVery similar to Rc, the only difference is the atomic nature of Arc works within a\nmulti-threaded environment. The reference count increments when a new clone() is created\nand decremented on drop(). The count allows for tracking the number of outstanding\ninstances of Arc and initiating memory cleanup when the last one goes out of scope (atomic\nreference count hits 0).\nMutex\nMutex provides us with shared\nmutability across threads while enforcing Rust's Borrow rules. This is similar to RefCell,\nexcept RefCell is not thread-safe.\nA Mutex helps preserves Rusts Borrow guarantees by enforcing exclusive access to the\nunderlying mutable object. Exclusive access can be taken by calling Mutex::try_lock()\n(Mutext::lock() will block). Here is an example of how to use a Mutex:\nThread-safety\nYou know its complicated when there is a\nchapter for it in the Rust\nNomicon. The Send and Sync traits help the Rust compiler reason about thread safety.\nThey are used to mark data that can be shared or moved across different threads. Typically\nthis is not safe to do for and requires the use of synchronization.\nSend:\nSend marks objects that can be\nsent to different threads (its ok to move ownership to a different thread).\nSome types that are marked Send:\nRefCell is a type that is\nSend\nbut not\nSync.\nThe reason why RefCell doesn't implement Sync is because it doesn't synchronize interior\nmutability (mutating internal state). This means that multiple threads could concurrently\nattempt to mutate the internal state and result in a race condition. RefCell is allowed to\nbe Send since its fine to mutate internal state within one thread if we transfer ownership\nof RefCell to that thread.\nSync:\nSync marks objects which are safe\nto share among threads (its ok to borrow a reference across threads).\nThe precise definition is: a type T is Sync if and only if &amp;T is Send. In other words,\nif there is no possibility of undefined behavior (including data races) when passing &amp;T\nreferences between threads.\nOr more concisely:\n&amp;T and &amp;mut T are Sync if and only if T is Sync\nSome std types that are used for synchronization and marked Sync:\nimpl Sync for Arc\nimpl&lt;T: ?Sized + Send&gt; Sync for Mutex&lt;T&gt;\nArc and Mutex implement Sync since they use synchronization (i.e. atomics and locks) to\nensure access to the data is exclusive even across multiple threads.\nTraits\nThe Rust type system is rich and allows us to express complex concepts to the compiler.\nDeref\nRust encourages the use of types, which encourages safe usage enforced by the compiler.\nFor example, rather than representing distance as usize, one should create a new-type\nDistance(usize). This helps maintain type checking but also allows us to attach special\ncontext around a Distance type.\nHowever, notice how the usage (1) is more verbose now and require accessing the inner\nfield dist2.0. Deref offers\nautomatic immutable dereferencing so that its possible avoid access the inner data without\nthe explicit access. By implementing Deref we are able to simplify the usage to &amp;dist2\nbelow.\nThe full example code is available in this Rust playground\nlink\nThis is a powerful tool but should be used carefully since it does mean we potentially\nlose the benefit of the new-type.\nDrop:\nIn our programs one need to perform \"cleanup\" after use or risk resource (memory) leakage\nor worse. This is a non-trivial problem in C where one needs a paranoid attitude (really\nall aspects of C require a paranoid attitude) to make sure that all resources are\nproperly cleaned up.\nRust offers us the Drop trait to make\nthis task trivial.\nThe Drop trait requires fn drop(&amp;mut self) function which is run when an object goes out\nof scope is no longer used. It should then run and \"destructor\" methods to cleanup\nassociated resources.\nThe Rust compiler recursively calls the drop() function on all fields of an object and\nimplements the Drop trait for std types (u8, u16, etc...) so that most of the time proper\ncleanup happens automatically. Here is a Rust playground\nlink\nwhich shows how the recursive drop functionality works.\nSo when should users implement the Drop trait themselves? In this description I have been\nusing \"resources\" rather than memory because I wanted to be general. Resources could\ninclude memory, network connection, file handle, locks, database cleanup, or any other\ncustom logic that users want to run at \"cleanup\".\nPhantomData\nPhantomData is considered\na phantom type. A phantom type is a type not actually present at runtime but instead used\nat compile time for static analysis.\nAdding a PhantomData field to your type tells the compiler that your type acts as\nthough it stores a value of type T, even though it doesn’t really. This information is\nused when computing certain safety properties.\nLets look at some example code:\nSo essentially, the Rust compiler will emit an unused warning if a generic type or\nlifetime is not actually used. PhantomData can be used to mute these warning. But why\nwould we have a type that we are not using?\nThe best usecase which demonstrates PhantomData's is the\nTypestate pattern. PhantomData&lt;T&gt; is used in\nthe Typestate pattern to switch implementation behavior based on the type T. However,\nsince there is no need to actually instantiate T (we only need the type T to switch\nbehavior), it will emit an unused warning unless included in PhantomData.\nUnpin\nThe vast majority of Rust types have no address-sensitive states. For example, an integer\ncan be copies to another address while maintaining the correct semantic. Most types implement\nthe Unpin auto-trait by default.\nOn the contrary, an object which is self-referential (contains a pointer to itself), will\nbecome invalid if the struct is moved to a different address. These objects need to be\nPined (see below) to prevent them from being accidentally move.\nPin (struct):\nIf an object should not be moved, then the user can Pin it by wrapping the object in a\nPin&lt;T&gt;. The pin module defines the\nconcept of \"pinning\" and has more detailed info.\nBut do we really need to care about pining? It seems complicated with little benefits. Why\ndoes the compiler care if a value is moved or not? If a user is writing self-referential\nobjects, they should be responsible for doing a proper copy/move.\nAll values in Rust are trivially moveable. This means that the address at which a value\nis located is not necessarily stable in between borrows. The compiler is allowed to move\na value to a new address without running any code to notify that value that its address\nhas changed.\nOk so the compiler can \"move\" an object at will. Sure that makes sense but its not very\nsatisfying and doesn't explain why the compiler need to move objects. The answer is\nasync programming in Rust.\nIn-order to support async, Rust had to essentially crate implicit Future objects that\ncould be polled, yield, and return. These objects also had to store state about the\nprogress of the Future (aka. self-referential objects). To seamlessly support async\nprogramming, the compile needed to reason about object moves and hence the need for\nUnpin auto-trait.\nSee comment and book\nchapter for further\ndetails.\nPhantomPinned:\nSimilar to PhantomData (discussed above),\nPhantomPinned is also a\nphantom type which is only useful for the Rust compiler's static analysis.\nWhere PhantomData was used to mark \"used\" parameters, PhantomPinned is used to mark a type\nas Pinned. Since there is no Pin trait, a more accurate statement from the official\ndocumentation states:\nA marker type which does not implement Unpin.\nIf a type contains a PhantomPinned, it will not implement Unpin by default.\nThis type can be used when you need to ensure that a type should not be moved. You might\nneed this if you are implementing some unsafe self referential code and should thoroughly\nunderstand pin.","id":"https://toidiu.com/blog/2024-08-22-rust-primitives/","title":"Rust primitives"},"https://toidiu.com/blog/2025-10-29-optimistic-ack-attack/":{"body":"Cross posting Blog post: Defending QUIC against the Optimistic\nACK attack.","id":"https://toidiu.com/blog/2025-10-29-optimistic-ack-attack/","title":"Defending QUIC from acknowledgement-based DDoS attacks"},"https://toidiu.com/blog/2025-12-25-privacy-and-control/":{"body":"\"I don't need to care about privacy because I have nothing to hide.\" is an\nargument that I have heard countless times.

Instead of \"privacy\" we really should be talking about\n\"control\". Framed in this context, we can more concretely talk about why it's\nimportant to protect your digital identity.\nFor me privacy is not the primary driver, because like you mentioned, it doesn't\nmake sense for the common folk and doesn't actually fall into people's threat\nmodel (journalists on the other hand should care). I am personally motivated by\nthe notion of \"control\". Can someone else meditate how I experience the world\nand what information I consume?

Watch the talk In Defense of\nPrivacy for a more on this.\nMany of the convenient tools we use today (email, messaging, social media,\npassword manager) are essential for daily life but they also yield control over\nto organizations (Google, Facebook, Amazon) that don't necessarily have our best\ninterest in mind [1][2].\nDiscussion\nlobste.rs\nHacker News\nMy setup\nQuestioning how \"incentives align\" is a really good litmus test for most\nthings.\nMost of the following recommendations are based on my own threat model and\ncomfort level. There will always be a compromise between effort and easy. It's\nbest to pick what fits your lifestyle.\nPassword manager\nUse a password manager! I use GNU pass because\nI don't want to hand over my passwords to a 3rd party. I typically only use the\npassword manager from my laptop and don't access passwords from my phone (I\nconsider this a better security practice). I have been meaning to try out\npassage. I would also recommend\nBitwarden for those who want a better UI experience.\nMessaging\nSignal for messaging is preferable [3]. (Whatsapp is an\nunfortunate exception and I hate that I need it to stay connected to friends and\nfamily).\nPhone\nI run GrapheneOS on my Android. This allows\nme to sandbox, disable or uninstall apps rather than allowing super-privileged\nGoogle/ISP apps from doing whatever they want on my personal device. By default,\nGoogle Play apps are\nunpriviledged and have\nto work within the sandbox model. GrapheneOS also allows you to restrict\npermissions at a granular level, including network access. You can also disable\napps that you only use occasionally (Venmo, ride-sharing, Google play store).\nI try to use opensource alternatives for apps on F-Droid. Did you know disabling\nGoogle play store (also location services) increases your battery life by a lot!\nNot running bloated stock OS also means your 5 year old phone is still fast and\nusable (wtf do I need to but a new phone every 2 years?). I barely use social\nmedia and don't install it on my phone (I use social media in Browser containers\nto limit 3rd party cookies).\nEmail\nI have a personal domain, which I use for email i.e. hello@toidiu.com. This\nallows me to switch providers whenever I want (e.g. lack of trust in Google,\nProtonMail can raise their prices). These days I am using\nTuta as my email provider because they are fast, offer a\nbetter price and have a strong focus on secure email. Also I can't be bothered\nto host my own email server.\nBrowsing\nI use firefox with privacy badger and uOrigin because I do not opt into\ncompanies personally targeting me (can be contentious since some sites use this\nto make money).\nCalendar/Contacts\nI host my calendar and contacts on a raspberrypi, which you can only access on\nlocalhost. The Caldav server is Baïkal, gets the job\ndone. I use DAVx⁵ to sync the contacts on my phone.\nDomain Registrar\nDisclaimer: Cloudflare is my current employer. I switched to Cloudflare\nRegistrar recently (prior to being employed by Cloudflare) because they offered\na lower price when my previous Registrar raised the price at renewal. I don't\nthink Cloudflare really cares to make money on domain registration and so it\npassed my \"incentives align\" test.\nDNS resolution\nEdit: some folks have called out my conflict of interest with Cloudflare and\nthe sensitivity of DNS. I think thats fair. Here is a Reddit thread of other\nDNS\nproviders\nso readers can make their own choice.\nDisclaimer: Cloudflare is my current employer.

They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.\nEarn Trust\nLeaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.\nDive Deep\nLeaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.\nHave Backbone; Disagree and Commit\nLeaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.\nDeliver Results\nLeaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion.

How often should\nwe skip packets? How many packets to skip? How do we track/clear skipped\npackets?\nAn endpoint that acknowledges packets it has not received might cause a\ncongestion controller to permit sending at rates beyond what the network\nsupports. An endpoint MAY skip packet numbers when sending packets to detect\nthis behavior. An endpoint can then immediately close the connection with a\nconnection error of type PROTOCOL_VIOLATION\nWe choose to skip 1 packet in the range [cwnd/2, cwnd*2]. Since we are trying to\ncontrol cwnd explosion, basing the skip value on cwnd scaled with the cwnd state\nover the lifetime of the connection.\nOther implementations were choosing this value statically.\nOnly skip a packet number after verifying the peer did not send the previous one.\nMany of the implementations were doing this check naively. They would skip\npackets at a regular interval, clearing the previous skipped pn. Only tracking a\nsingle skipped packet and clearing the skipped pn, before verifying the peer did\nnot ack the previous skipped packet means that they were not necessarily doing\nthe mitigation (depending on which packed was skipped).\nThe above method allowed us to only skip a single pn (small mem footprint),\nwhile also effectively mitigating the attack.\nExample:\nActual calculation:\ns2n-quic: Onboarded CloudFront to s2n-quic for HTTP/3 support\nTime to First Byte (TTFB) improved by 23.5% overall, but especially on Android with a 37.1%\nimprovement. Additionally, customer engagement metrics from Snap showed improvement to story view\ntimes, ad impressions, and a reduction in viewer cancellation counts.\ns2n-quic was more performant due to the following reasons.\ncc algorithm (one of the main driver of the TTFB)\ncustom amplification factor\ngain value\nloss threshold values\ninitial cwnd value\nmtu probing\npacket pacing\ngso\necn\ntesting\nperformance via flamegraph\nnetbench\nzero cost event framework\ncustom data structures\nack range: interval set\npacket number map: ring buffer which stores consequetive values and allows\nfor ranged delete\ns2n-quic/s2n-tls: Async cert loading\nhttps://github.com/aws/s2n-quic/issues/1137\nCurrently s2n-quic does the certificate lookup/loading operations synchronously.\nNon ideal for application which handle multiple connections concurrently. The\nwork allowed for certificate lookup/loading operations to be performed\nasynchronously and enable non-blocking behavior.\ns2n-quic: pass the connection waker down to the tls libraries so that they\ncould wake on progress\ns2n-tls: The work involved converting the callback is only invoked once to a\npoll the callback model in s2n-tls. s2n-tls by default did not allow for poll\ncallbacks. s2n-tls previously only called the callback once, which not the\nRust model and has quite a few drawbacks. Polling only once means the\napplication/s2n-quic has to schedule (separate thread possibly) the completion\nof the callback. It also needs to manage the state associated with the\ncallback separately. The Rust polling model allows for all state associated\nwith the future to live within the object bing polled. Additionally, the\nfuture can make progress as part of the already existing runtime that s2n-quic\nstarts with.\ns2n-tls bindings: gluing the new callback polling behavior in an extensible\nway for other callbacks.\ns2n-quic: ACK frequency optimizations\nlink: https://github.com/aws/s2n-quic/issues/1276\nInitial experiments with single batch did not show much improvements. Theory\nwas that having to aggregate acks and then process it separately was just as\nexpensive (cost savings of 2-3% simply didn't materialize) as simply processing\nthe acks individually.\nDelaying ack meant:\ndelayed signals to CC and loss recovery\ndelayed processing of ECN signals (mitigated by processing immediately)\nmtu discovery (mitigated by not delaying mtu probes)\nhandshake and anti-amplificaiton (mitigated by delaying after the handshake)\nProposed solutions: 3 possible solutions\nsingle payload batch would aggregate acks from multiple packets (10) and\nprocess them once (gso by default batches 10 packets). projected cost savings\nof 2-3% based on flamegraph.\nProjected Pros:\nrelative CPU savings of ~20%\nbytes/instruction (150k → 125k)\nsyscalls savings (20k → 6k)\nThis solution does not affect LR and CC!!\nmulti payload batch would store the acks and process them at some delay. this\nwould be equivalent to implementing the RFC, except it can be implemented\nlocally without having to negotiate with the peer. (batch acks from multiple\npayloads would require additional storage and tracking)\nProjected Pros:\nmore sophisticated delay strategy based on time/packets\ndoesn't require negotiating extension with peer\na stepping stone towards full RFC compliance\nCons:\nAffects CC and LR\nrequires tuning and experimental data to fine-tune\nack freq rfc (the full rfc, which requires the peer to negotiate)\nProjected Pros:\ncan influence peer ack delay\nCons:\nAffects CC and LR\nrequires tuning and experimental data to fine-tune\nrequires peer to negotiate\ns2n-quic: Connection Migration\nhttps://github.com/aws/s2n-quic/pulls?q=is%3Apr+connection+migration+is%3Aclosed+author%3Atoidiu\nConnection migration is one of the selling features of QUIC. It addresses the\nmodern network usage pattern where clients running on phones switch from one cell\ntower to another. Reestablishing a new connection requires a new handshake to\nestablish new keys. Additionally, any in-progress transfers might have to start\nover.\nQUIC facilitates Connection Migration by introducing an explicit ConnectionId,\nrather than using ip/port to identify a connection. This allows a server to tie\na client connection which is changing ip/ports back to the same connection\ncontext and avoid a new handshake.\ns2n-quic: client implementation\nhttps://github.com/aws/s2n-quic/issues/1009\nAWS is primarily a datacenter company so the initial implementation of s2n-quic\nonly supported the server usecase. I added client support to the library.\nPreviously integration tests were based on a third-party QUIC library(quinn)\nwhich made introspection and configuration more difficult. Adding client support\nmeant owning the entire QUIC stack for both the client and server. This\neventually enabled more sophisticated integration and fuzz testing.\nThe task involved reading the QUIC RFC for all requirements and implementing the\nfeatures to support to the library.\ns2n-quic: Event framework\nhttps://github.com/aws/s2n-quic/issues/439\nThe event framework is a zero-cost abstraction which allows customers to enable\nlogging for s2n-quic. This kind of falls out of the sans I/O methodology.\nThe original verion of this was done with syntax macros, which I worked on\nextensively. The final implementation was a standalone Rust token parse (via syn\ncrate) and outputed a generated.rs file. The parser was responsible for\ncorrectly constructing events, their default impl, testing impl and builder\npattern for each event.\ns2n-tls: Pedantic Valgrind checks\nhttps://github.com/aws/s2n-tls/issues/3758\nInspired by s2n_cleanup not properly cleaning up.\nLeaks of kind \"Still reachable\" were not caught by Vangrind because by default\nValgrind enables \"definite and possible\". While this might be a safe assumption\nfor applications it is not for libraries that need to cleanup possibly stateful\nresources. Solution was to run --errors-for-leak-kinds=all in tests.\ns2n-tls: Openssl 3.0 support\nTODO expand on this work. low\nhttps://github.com/aws/s2n-tls/issues/3442\ns2n-netbench: orchestrator\nTODO expand on this work. low\nNot mentioned in resume\ns2n-quic: Support min, initial, max MTU per connection\nSome mobile networks will fragment and reassemble packets despite the DNF (do no\nfragment) flag. While this is a good thing for availability, it skews MTU\nprobing measurements and results in dereased throughput due to packet loss.\ns2n-quic probes for the max mtu values on each network path and uses that to\nthat when sending packets. Since mobile networks are essentially claiming larger\nMTU values than the path actually supports, s2n-quic continues to send larger\nMTU values. Additionally, fragmenting/reassembing is an expensive operation\n(io/cpu/time), which requies the fragmented packets to be buffered and then\nreassemble.\nThe result is that s2n-quic sends larger and larger packets, which take longer\nand longer for the mobile network to process. This results in packet loss and an\noverall decrease in throughput.\ns2n-quic Presented a talk at CryptoCon\nI presented a talk about s2n-quic and the QUIC protocol at CryptoCon, an internal AWS cryptography\nconference. The talk was recored and shared in the internal Amazon video repository.\nThe goal of the talk was to illuminate what makes QUIC a novel protocol over the\nprevious iterations: TLS1.3, TLS1.2, etc. Imo the biggest shift in QUIC was\nmoving critical protocol components from the kernel-space to user-space (CC,\nrecovery, pacing). This shift allowed for quicker iterations but comes at the\nhigher cost and complexity of the user-space implementation.\ns2n-quic: Add fips support which lead to issues when updating rustls to use aws-lc by default\nrustls doesnt have a stable API and is pre-1.x. Additionally, it frequently\npublishes breaking changes (although the introduction of\nhttps://github.com/rustls/pki-types might mean a more stable API).\ns2n-quic is 1.x\ns2n-quic took a dep on rustls.\ns2n-quic re-exported some rustls types.\nrustls broke API in new versions.\nUpgrading rustls would mean breaking API for s2n-quic.\ncreated internal customer list\ns2n-quic: rustls testing and parity\ns2n-quic: advocate better slowloris mitigation\ns2n-quic: handshake status\nhttps://github.com/aws/s2n-quic/pull/960\nIdentified missing loose requirement with the handshake status.

Therefore I took a few precautions to eliminate the risk.\nUsed randomint() VCL function to distribute the traffic.\nI decided the a % based rollout, and then progressed to do it over 3 weeks.\nR\nAt each 10% increase I gained additional confidence, about the new configs. Watching\nthe cache hit ratio (89%), the traffic pattern also remained the same. Additionally,\nby communicating with the rest of my team as well as being aware of other company\nevents, I was able to aviod being suspect of any failures by mistake.\nThe result was a clean migration, a more resilient system and probably a higher\nmorale since there were no outages.","id":"https://toidiu.com/brag/ihr-fastly-cache-migration/","title":"Fastly blacklist to whitelist migration"},"https://toidiu.com/brag/ihr-ha-support-for-ds-data/":{"body":"invent and simplify: come up with a solution and then simplify\nearn trust: negotiate a solution with DS to further the relationship\nfrugality: reuse dynamo, jenkins rather than invent new solution\nmetrics\nnightly job; system designed for time agnostic release\nkept 7 days of backups\nprovide interface for testing\nreuse existing infrastructure (dynamo, jenkins, schema models)\npoll for new dataset every 5 min\nS\nData Science (DS) ran a nightly job to generate music recommendations for\nusers.\nThe dataset would live in DynamoDB and the old DS workflow was to rewrite the\nsame dynamo table with new dataset each night.\nThis was a high risk operation for the my team (APIs).

I like half-crimp, middle two open and pinch. When selecting grips keep in mind that isometric training trains the grip roughly 20 degrees in either direction, so a half crimp grip will strengthen sloper strength and full crimp strength. A pinch grip is probably a good one to include because it gets the thumb into the action. For pinches I use what I like to call pinch blocks because these eliminate the compression effect you can get when training on fixed pinches. These are a 2x6 cut into 8 inch sections and then screwed together with an eye bolt to hang weight from. The width on the pinches can then range from 1.5\", 3\", and 4.5\" (see video for a better explanation). I think the 3\" one is best, thinking about the 20 degree training effect. choose middle two, primarily because this is a weak grip for me, but I also think it is the most universally used for pockets. It trains two thirds of the fingers for first three and half the fingers for monos. This highlights a general principal for climbing training which is to simplify and pick exercises that will work the largest range of climbing situations.\nAfter taking two days off from climbing. Start with a 13 second hang from the grip at body weight this should give you a rough idea of how much weight to add. When selecting a hold it should be a hold that is large enough such that weight can be added but not so large that the grip changes (E.g. hanging from a handle bar is not a half crimp). The starting body weight hang should help in grip selection. In addition, I prefer 2-arm hangs because 1-arm hangs will over stress the shoulders.\nOnce a hold has been found that can be hung relatively easily with the particular grip for 13 seconds start adding weight resting about 5 minutes in between each hang attempt. Keep adding weight until you can't hang the hold for 13 seconds. Write this weight down, this will be the weight you'll use for your training. It may seem obvious but remember to include your body weight in the total weight hung.\nAn entire climbing day should be devoted to the determination of maximum weight and two rest days should be taken after determining the maximum weight. If it takes more than 5 attempts to reach your 1 rep max then chances are whatever you arrive at is probably not your 1 rep max, you can do more. Take two rest days and try again.\nResources\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20170505101457/http://www.stevemaischtraining.com/fingerboarding-for-maximum-strength.html\nhttps://www.trainingbeta.com/media/tbp-025-steve-maisch","id":"https://toidiu.com/personal/fitness/fingerboarding/","title":"fingerboard protocol"},"https://toidiu.com/personal/fitness/focus/":{"body":"Theory\nwhy you cant focus: brain is a muscle and you need to train it to focus. you cant lift 300 pounds if you dont train to do that\nmodern world is full of distractions and you dont get chances to focus\nHow to improve focus\nignore distractions and bring your focus back to work\nthis is painful;

But how\ndo you do that? The following is written from the standpoint of a UX designer, but you can easily\nadapt it to your domain.\nShare best practices\nShare best practices in one-off settings (Slack, Email, meetings, etc.)\nMake your thought process visible\nHighlight others' great examples\nTake on a mentee or an apprentice\nBecome a mentor or start office hours\nPro tip: Don’t just share a best practice or a link to an interesting article,\ndescribe the thought process behind it and why it’s relevant to your audience.\nThis makes advice more useful—nobody will be solving the exact same problem as\nyou in the future, but the approach can be similar.\nCreate internal documentation\nAWS Ops Wins (case studies that reduce latency, cost and errors to AWS and\nour customers)\nDocument writing for designers\nProject milestones and resources\nInternal docsite: Design system documentation\nInternal Q&amp;A platform: Answer a question publicly, i.e. on Sage, or on\nAnswers\nIn all these examples: When you document a best practice, others are able to\nlearn from you without the need for a face-to-face interaction\nWrite a blog or newsletter:\nWrite It Right\nLuu's Tran’s Blog\nAdam Elman’s Blog\nMaking Great Decisions Blog\nHost in-person training (mentor at scale):\nRequired new employee training (i.e. Peculiar UX)\nRegular 1-to-1, 1-to-many coaching (i.e. Office Hours, CXBR consultations,\npresentations)\nSeasonal training sessions\nRecord videos:\nFor all Amazonians: Working Backwards\nFor UX: Design tutorials\nFor UX, PM, and Devs: Kumo Clips\nCreate templates\nDoc templates:\nAmazon-wide document templates\nOrg-wide templates for project kick-offs, research reports, and other common\nproject milestones\nPro tip: Create a template whenever there’s an activity that happens over and\nover again and is done by different people. Combine sharing best practices (#1\nabove) with creating templates to make your guidance easier to copy and more\nactionable\nDesign templates:\nCompositions of design system components\nPresentation templates\nResearch methods (i.e. a great participant screener template for\nusertesting.com would ensure more inclusive recruiting for others' research\nprojects)\nIdeation / workshop templates:\nQuip templates for remote workshops\nQuip templates for self-service ideation sessions\nCode templates:\nDesign files + design system component code\nCode templates make it easy to reuse patterns. Patterns may reduce unnecessary\noverrides of the design system.\nDecision-tree templates:\nAWS Well-Architected\nBuild tools\nExamples of tools built by Amazonians:\nPR/FAQ Writing Tool\nUX Writer Tool\nAmazon Accessibility Evaluator\nNon-inclusive Term Converter\nPolicy Engine (discover problems that need attention)\nKumo Automation Service (a framework that allows people to build tools to automate away support issues)\nPro tip: Great tools apply best practices automatically to someone’s document,\ncode, or designs.\nIntroduce a new mental model\nMental model examples:\nCompany-wide: Leadership Principles\nOrg: RACI framework (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed), used to make decision-making more efficient\nOrg/Team:\nShape the culture via a vision/mission statement\nTenets – especially aspirational tenets, which will allow you to push your team's bar higher\nList of key truths or decisions made to establish a common ground during discussions\nReturns Progress Tracker\nProduct: Product framework (a product framework may expand the scope of work and ground future conversations):\n\"Zones\" framework on Product Detail Pages (video – 12:18+)\nPro tip: Great mental models are principles and frameworks that set a new,\nhigher standard for the team’s work quality.

This not only avoided traditional concurrency problems and also capped the performance to system resources rather than the application framework. See Seastar for more info on the async engine used in Scylla.\nA shared-nothing (one shard/core)architecture was used to avoid using locks. This lets the application developer avoid context, cache invalidation, and locks. Instead shared memory queues are used to communicated between shards. So like Cassandra, the entire dataset of the cluster is sharded to nodes(machines), but additionally, the data on the node is sharded per core.\nCassandra uses a key cache and row cache in addition to the general purpose Linux page cache. This adds complixity with unpredictable performance. Scylla chose to implement a singe unified cache which can tune itself depending on the current workload. It also uses things like direct memory access(DMA) to access disk when there is a cache miss. DMA operates independent of CPU.\nScylla utilizes I/O schedulers to self tune and balance between foreground and background I/O operations. The tool scylla_ io_setup is used to ensure maximum useful disk concurrency while maintaining good latency and not overloading drives.\nThe self-tuning capabilities allow Scylla to make informed decisions without manual intervention or needing to hire an expert.

In terms of a caching, this means to take item (i), hash it (good distribution) and then assign it to the available caches (C), maybe with modulo: hash\\_fn(i) % C. There are two problems with this approach. First is that the distribution is a function of the servers, so as we add or remove servers, we now need to recalculate the modulo and therefore the distribution. The second problem, which derives from the first, is that now each server node now needs to be updated - said differently, each server node now needs to be aware of every node. Consensus is hard, so this is not ideal.\nSection 4 contained proof and discussion of Consistent Hashing.\nThe authors define 4 properties that define their notion of consistency: balance requires that the hash function distribute the objects in a balanced fashion amongst the buckets. monotonicity says if items are initially assigned to a set of buckets and then some new buckets are added, then an item may move from an old bucket to a new bucket, but not from one old bucket to another. spread implies that references for a given object are only directed to a small number of caching machines. load implies that no one cache is assigned an unreasonable number of objects.objects.\nNext they define some properties of a good ranged hash function: Given Rb(hash for buckets) and Ri(hash for items). An item i should be assigned to the closest bucket. Given max of C buckets. For each bucket create k*log(C), some constant k virtual buckets and map them using the hash function Rb. To save space, have Rb and Ri map to the range [0,1]. To differentiate a point from another, we only needs to have log(number of points) random bits (decimal precision) identifying a point.\nLastly they share an efficient implementation of a possible consistent hash function: Use a balanced binary search tree to store the buckets and their assignment in the range. If there are C buckets, then there will be k*C*log(C) entries, which gives a worse tree depth of log(C) and a worse possible calculation of log(C). The time for adding and removing a bucket is log^2(C) since we would need to remove k*log(C) points. To reduce this time to constant lookup, the authors suggest dividing the range into k*C*log(C) equal length segments and have a separate tree for each one. This allows us to more predictably have one bucket per segment. The problem with segments is that it requires smaller segments as more buckets are added. An amortized way recommended by the authors is to choose intervals of size 1/2^x such that 1/2^x &lt; 1/k*C*log(C). Then as new buckets are added, gradually bisect each section.","id":"https://toidiu.com/reads/consistent-hashing-and-random-trees-distributed-caching-protocols-for-relieving-hot-spots-on-the-world-wide-web/","title":"Consistent Hashing and Random Trees: Distributed Caching Protocols for Relieving Hot Spots on the World Wide Web"},"https://toidiu.com/reads/hmac-keyed-hashing-for-message-authentication-rfc2104/":{"body":"original rfc: https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2104.txt\nintroduction\nThe paper quotes MD5 and SHA-1 (SHA-3 should probably be used) as viable cryptographic hash functions.

Keys need to be chosen at random using a cryptographically strong pseudo-random generator and periodically refreshed.\ntruncated output\nTruncation of the output MAC is a known practice since the entire length is not need to verify that the hash was computed. This can save on transmission bandwidth I imagine but not sure how useful it is. The recommendation is that the truncation not be less than half the length of the output and not less than 80 bits (might be more in modern days).\nsecurity\nthe construction of HMAC is independent of the details of a particular hash function\nmessage authentication, as opposed to encryption, has a \"transient\" effect. so that breaking a cryptographic function today will require us to change the function to prevent future MACs.

This post was critical for my understanding.\nThe proof is comprised of two lemmas. The first lemma showed that there must be some initial configuration where consensus is not yet determined (caused by errors or message delays). Think of this as bivalent (having two possible truths) state. The second lemma shows that it is always possible to remain in a bivalent state by delaying a message.\nLets note the assumptions made by the proof: The underlying transport protocol is reliable; messages are delivered correctly and exactly once. There is no synchronized clock, and it is not possible to detect a slow process vs a dead process. Additionally, the proof relaxes the termination requirement and requires that only some process eventually decide on a value (weak consensus). Put another way, a message will always be delivered but can be delayed and can be delivered out-of-order.\nFor Strong Consensus these 3 properties must hold: termination: eventually, every correct process decides some value. agreement: all processes that decide do so on the same value. validity: the value must have been proposed by some process.\nBy proving their results under assumptions of weak concensus, the authors are able to extend the result to strong concensus systems.","id":"https://toidiu.com/reads/impossibility-of-distributed-consensus-with-one-faulty-process/","title":"Impossibility of Distributed Consensus with One Faulty Process"},"https://toidiu.com/reads/in-search-of-an-understandable-consensus-algorithm-extended-raft/":{"body":"Note: It is not possible to summarize the details of the Raft implementation so I will instead cover some high-level points/decision/tradeoffs by by the authors(take a look at the paper which highlights important content). Also sections (6)Log Compaction and (7)Cluster membership changes are currently left out.\nIt should be noted that there is distinction between the entry log and state machine. The log is a mechanism used to make progress while an update to the state machine(an index pointing to the log) precludes that a entry and all previous entries have been committed(a decision was made).\nRaft seperates the protocol into 3 different modes (leader election, log replication and safety). It first elects a leader(choose a new one if current one fails) and gives it complete control for managing the replicated log(accept entries from client, replicating entries and committing entries). The safety property guarantees that if an entry is committed to the state machine, all members of the cluster agreed upon the value.\nA member of the cluster can only be in one of 3 states: leader, follower, candidate. A term is used as a logical clock in Raft(clock skew makes this a good choice). There are two RPC in Raft (RequestVote and AppendEntries) and they are idempotent.\nLeader Election: A heartbeat mechanism is used to track the liveliness of the leader. There is only ever 1 leader (term is used to decide the which leader is valid). A failure to elect a leader(split vote, packet loss) will cause members to timout (150-300ms) and issue a RequestVote of their own and thus starting a new election.\nLog Replication: A leader is the only one that can modify the logs. It services client request and sends AppendEntries RPC in parallel to members. Once an entry has been safely replicated, it will answer the client. At the start of leadership, the leader will force all members to match its logs and therefore delete log entries from followers if necessary. The log on the leader is only ever append only.\nSafety: A restriction for voting for a leader is that the RequestVote RPC includes log information and the voter denies the vote if its own log is more up-to-date than that of the candidate. This ensures that the winning candidate must contain all committed entries since a majority vote is needed.\nA caveat: clients send all interactions to the leader(a follower will reject and provide information about the current leader). Therefore the leader is responsible for handling all reads and writes which could cause hot-spot on a single server. Additionally, even a read-only operation requires the leader to verify it has the latest information and thus contact a majority of the members.\nA caveat: Paxos is a paper and implementations vary out in the field. Egalitarian Paxos (EPaxos) can achieve higher performance under some conditions with a leaderless approach; however it is more complex.","id":"https://toidiu.com/reads/in-search-of-an-understandable-consensus-algorithm-extended-raft/","title":"In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm (Extended Raft)"},"https://toidiu.com/reads/making-quic-quicker-with-nic-offload/":{"body":"Kernel-userspace data copy accounts for 40-50% of total CPU usage.
