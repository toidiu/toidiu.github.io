    <p>There are two types of Virtual Machines: system VM and process/language VM. A language VM
is also called a runtime (while true for Java and JVM this is typically not the
nomenclature with other languages). One abstracts out the OS while the other abstracts out
a language runtime. A system VM might be good for isolation, security, portability, etc. A
language VM is good for portability of a language (think JVM). For the purpose of this
article we will consider system VMs.</p>

<p>Note: these are some thoughts I compiled awhile ago and only now getting to posting them.
I am trying to get in the habit of pushing out content more consistently rather than
waiting for it to be perfect.. so please let me know if there are errors or if I have

<h4 id="hypervisor-https-en-m-wikipedia-org-wiki-hypervisor">Hypervisor: (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor)</h4>
<p>A hypervisor or virtual machine manager (VMM) is computer software, firmware or hardware
that creates and runs virtual machines. A computer on which a hypervisor runs one or more
virtual machines is called a host machine, and each virtual machine is called a guest
machine. The hypervisor presents the guest operating systems with a virtual operating
platform and manages the execution of the guest operating systems. Multiple instances of a
variety of operating systems may share the virtualized hardware resources.</p>
<h4 id="kvm-https-en-m-wikipedia-org-wiki-kernel-based-virtual-machine">KVM: (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel-based_Virtual_Machine)</h4>
<p>Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) is a virtualization infrastructure for the Linux kernel
that turns it into a hypervisor. It was merged into the Linux kernel mainline in kernel
version 2.6.20, which was released on February 5, 2007.</p>
<h4 id="stack-machine-https-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-stack-machine">Stack machine: (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_machine)</h4>
<p>Instructions in a computer can be implemented via a stack or via a register. A register
machine will specify register where its operands and results are. The stack machine on the
other hand will assume operands are on the stack and will place the result on the stack as
well. For example an <code>Add</code> instruction will pop its operands of the stack and will push
the result onto the stack to prepare for the next instruction.</p>
<p>Some advantages of stack machines are:</p>
<ul>
<li>compact object code(smaller code size)</li>
<li>simple copilers</li>
<li>simple interpreters</li>
<li>fast operand access</li>
<li>minimal processor state</li>
</ul>
<p>Some disadvantages of stack machines are:</p>
<ul>
<li>more memory references</li>
<li>common evaluations can't easily be factored out</li>
<li>ridgid code order</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="firecracker">Firecracker:</h4>
<p>Firecracker is a microVM written in Rust :) Being mico, it is lightweight and offers all
the benefits of a VM without the overhead (consumes about 5Mib memory). Because it is
written in Rust, it offers safety and performances guarantees. It is currently being used
by Amazon to power their Lambda and Fargate services.</p>
