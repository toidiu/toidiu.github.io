    <p>TLS is the protocol that secures most of the browse web traffic on the internet. The
internet is more secure than it has ever been but what exactly does that mean. What are
the guarantees that TLS provides and how exactly does it deliver on its promise?</p>

<h2 id="tls-guarantees"><a name="tls-guarantees">TLS guarantees</a></h2>
<p>The goal of the TLS protocol is to secure network communication. More formally it aim to
provide 3 security properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Authentication: is the peer who they say they are.</li>
<li>Confidentiality: messages between two peers are secret and only visible to the peers</li>
<li>Integrity: messages sent to peers are tamper proof. A tampered message can be detected.</li>
</ul>
<p>But how exactly does TLS enforce these properties?</p>
<h3 id="authentication"><a name="tls-authentication">Authentication</a></h3>
<p>In TLS authentication is satisfied by the use of certificates. A server sends its
certificate during the handshake. The client will optionally send its certificate if the
server requests mutual authentication (aka. mutual TLS or mTLS).</p>
<p>Trusting a certificate is complicated and typically involves parsing a certificate chain
(<code>root-cert =&gt; intermediate-cert =&gt; peer-cert</code>). Trust is established if the server trusts
one of the certificates in the chain. <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280">RFC
5280</a> defines the modern day certificate
infrastructure known as x.509 PKI (Public Key Infrastructure). Modern web browsers come
installed with well-established root certificates (Cloudflare root, Mozilla root, etc)
which helps facilitate the internet.</p>
<p>The certificate contains the server's public key pair and can be used to verify
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature">signatures</a> created by the server.
Signatures are used by the TLS handshake to ensure that browser is speaking with the &quot;real&quot;
peer (toidiu.com) and not an attacker. This works since only the real &quot;toidiu.com&quot; website
server will have the private key associated with the public key on the certificate.</p>
<h3 id="confidentiality"><a name="tls-confidentiality">Confidentiality</a></h3>
<p>Confidentiality is achieved via encryption and its usually what most people think of when
they think of &quot;security&quot;. However, Confidentiality without Authentication (are you sure
you are talking with your Bank?) or Integrity (are you really sure that some hacker didn't
intercept and modify the message?) is not comprehensive security!</p>
<p>Peers using TLS, exchange a shared secret key, which they use to encrypt messages they
send to each other. The exchange of secret material is called a key exchange (kex) and is
part of a TLS Handshake. There are many kex algorithms (RSA, DHE, EDHE). TLS 1.3 has
deprecated many old cipher suites in preference for modern ones.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman">ECDHE</a> (elliptic
curve diffie-hellman ephemeral) makes a fine choice because of additional security
properties (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy">forward-secret</a>) and
performance compared with other algotithms.</p>
<p>To ensure a secure exchange, the TLS 1.3 kex samples key material (kem) from both the
client and server when deriving the master secret key (<code>client-public-kem + server-public-kem =&gt; master-secret-key</code>).</p>
<h3 id="integrity"><a name="tls-integrity">Integrity</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_authentication_code">MAC</a> (message authentication
code) is a cryptographic primitive that can be used to check the integrity of a piece of
data. During the TLS handshake both peers agree upon a &quot;secret key&quot;, which is then used to
generate MACs for messages exchanged.</p>
<p>Very similar to a digital signature, the MAC can be used to verify that the message was in
fact sent by the peer and not tampered with, i.e. Integrity. Check out this stackover post
for the difference between <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/5647">digital signature vs
MAC</a>.</p>
<p>In previous TLS protocols, the MAC was calculated separately. In TLS 1.3, only
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_encryption">AEAD</a> cipher suites are supported
so MAC and encryption happen together.</p>
<h2 id="sub-protocols"><a name="sub-protocols">Sub protocols</a></h2>
<p>The TLS protocol is divided into two sub protocols: Handshake and Record.</p>
<h3 id="handshake-protocol"><a name="handshake-protocol">Handshake protocol</a></h3>
<p>The Handshake protocol is responsible for performing a key exchange with the
peer. The secret material generated from the key exchange is then used in the
Record protocol to encrypt data.
<a href="https://tls13.xargs.org/">https://tls13.xargs.org/</a> provides an interactive
diagram of the TLS 1.3 handshake.</p>
<pre data-lang="txt" class="language-txt "><code class="language-txt" data-lang="txt">    Client                                               Server

Handshake protocol:
    ClientHello               --------&gt;
                                                    ServerHello
                                          [generate secret key]
                              &lt;--------              {Finished}

    [generate secret key]
    {Finished}                --------&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The TLS protocol is extensible via the use of extesions. The peers can negotiate
extensions in order to enable certain features. Some of these extensions are
optional, while others are required for normal operation. A few of them include:</p>
<ul>
<li>server_name: specify the name of the server (useful for load balancing)</li>
<li>heartbeat: remember the Heartbleed bug?</li>
<li>supported_groups: allow a client to enumerate the elliptic curves it supports
and/or the point formats it can parse.</li>
<li>&quot;signature extensions&quot;: I specifically choose these because they are subtly
different and caused me much confusion in the past <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#section-4.2.3">RFC
section</a>
<ul>
<li>signature_algorithms: applies to signatures in the CertificateVerify
message. This signature is generated by one of the TLS peers (client of
server) and used to authenticate the handshake was tamper proof. More on
this below.</li>
<li>signature_algorithms_cert: allows a client to indicate which signature
algorithms it can validate in X.509 certificates. This signature is
generated by CAs (certificate authorities) and used to validate the
certificate chain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Difference between <code>signature_algorithms</code> and <code>signature_algorithms_cert</code></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>signature_algorithms:
<ul>
<li>Certificate message: As part of the handshake, a Server provides the Client
with its certificate (its identitiy).</li>
<li>CertificateVerify message: This message is used to provide explicit proof
that the Server possesses the private key corresponding to its certificate.
This is done by using the private key to <strong>sign some data</strong>. The algorithm
used to sign this data must be in the <code>signature_algorithms</code> extension.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>signature_algorithms_cert:
<ul>
<li>We discussed certificate chains above. A chain could mean that the
certificate for this website (leaf) is <strong>signed</strong> by some intermediatary,
which is <strong>signed</strong> by some root certificate. root-&gt;intermediate-&gt;leaf.</li>
<li>My web browser might not trust every leaf certificate (every single website
on the internet), but might trust some small number of root certificates.</li>
<li>My browser is able to validate that chain by verifying that the root
signature on the leaf certificate.</li>
<li>The algorithm allowed for these certificate signature must be in the
<code>signature_algorithms_cert</code> extension list.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="record-protocol"><a name="record-protocol">Record protocol</a></h3>
<p>Once the Handshake protocol is complete, the peers now share the same secret key
which they can use to encrypt/decrypt message. At this point it is possible for
the peers to send encrypted data to each another.</p>
