    <p>Writing is thinking and can often facilitate executing tasks. It can be especially
invaluable when tackling complex tasks. This is because it takes clarity of though to
write well; clarity being the key to unwinding a complex issue. However, writing well can
take time, requiring multiple drafts and revisions.</p>
<p>I believe that one doesn't actually need the perfect final draft. In most cases first
draft usually provides majority of the value.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>At the start of a project there are many different paths. As you start a project you might
have to go about exploring each fork. This can be expensive. If you are lucky or
experienced you might end up on the correct path the first time around but likely you will
need to at least think about each fork as you come upon it.</p>
<p>Writing is a tool which allow you to explore test out the different paths very cheaply. By
writing out your project plan you are eliminating many possible paths you would otherwise
end up exploring.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of this elimination, we are reaping value even from the first draft.
Since most projects are not necessarily complex, even the first draft is likely to provide
value and clarity of thought. Don't let the fear or perfection stop you from taking the
first step.</p>
