In this post I will be reviewing `scala.collection.breakOut` from an application developer's perspective rather than a functional programming enthusiast. I will discuss why one would want to use it and how to recognize when it is applicable. The full code sample can be found at [github](https://github.com/toidiu/Scala-breakOut).

When I first saw `breakOut`, it seemed like an extremely intimidating concept and a little like black magic. It certainly didn't help that I found explanations of `breakOut` intermingled with the equally intimidating concept of `CanBuildFrom`. This is a shame because, with proper application, `breakOut` can make your code run faster. Let's consider the following code sample:

#### Why we care

```scala
val list = List("one", "two", "three", "four")

val expensiveMap = list      //type Map[Int, String] is infered by the compiler
  .map(n => n.length -> n)     //1
  .toMap                    //2
```

The problem with this code is that it is memory inefficient. We first create an intermediate list at line (1) and then convert it to a Map on line (2). Ideally we could do it all in one step. Well thanks to `breakOut` we can!

```scala
import scala.collection.breakOut
val list = List("one", "two", "three", "four")

val efficientMap: Map[Int, String] = list   //you need to specify the type
  .map(n => (n.length, n))(breakOut)
```

This results in the `Map` we want without the intermediate list. Win!

#### When to use

So when should we use `breakOut`? An easy way to remember when to use it is if we have the following list of conditions:

- we have a traversable collection (List, Seq, Vector)
- we want to transform the elements (pairing the string length with the string)
- we want the final output to be a `Map`


#### Conclusion
Scala has a robust immutalbe collections library, which has a tendency to make it more GC heavy. However, with some attention to the implementation details, it is possible to remain efficient and functional.
