I am starting a new project called [Reads](/reads) where I will cover various topics of interest to me.

 The task will be to read, highlight and summarize a paper, and possibly accompany it with some code.

The primary goal of this project is to create a reference for myself, as well as gaining a better understanding of the topics.
