A list of good and bad company indicators compiled mostly from personal experience.

### Good Indicators
- Communication. For me the number one indicator of a good work place culture is responsive and detailed communication from the company. 
    + This shows respect for the candidate's time.
    + It indicates an organized management structure.
    + It makes it easy to interview.
- Efficiency/organization. Single point of contact (designated person)
    + There are a lot of moving parts so it is always best to have a default single point of contact for the company. The candidate could still have the option to contact people in specific roles.
- Respect for time. A company should detail out what a successful hire will look like and its time-frame.
    + Realize that the candidate might be interview at other places so it's best to set expectations and stick to them. Lay out all the different stages of the interview and their time-frame.
- Caring. A company should ask what the candidate needs to help them make a decision. 
    + This indicates that the company cares about it's people rather than simply hiring someone to get the job done.
    + Each candidate has different priorities. This could be meeting people on the team, viewing code style, work place setup, benefits...


### Bad indicators
- Bad communication. This can either be lack of clear instructions or simply lack of communication.
    + If it takes 25 emails (actually happened b/c of last minute cancellation) to schedule an appointment, that is a big alert sign.
    + Don't know when to expect a response. Will it be different when you work there?
    + If you promise to respond/review by a certain day and then don't.
    + A total lack of communication should be an alert of deeper issues.
    + Makes it a pain to schedule things and focus on the important things.
- No respecting other's time. Canceling an appointment/on-site with little prior notice.
    + Do your best to not cancel in the first place, otherwise provide a good reason. 
    + Besides the scheduling over-head this screams mismanagement.
- Enforcing a short (24-hr) limit on home code challenges (actually happened).
    + Bad sleep or other events could cause discrepancy in the result.
    + No one writes good software in 24 hrs. As mentioned above I believe the point of home challenge is to see coding style.
    + It further shows the company has incorrect priorities (working code rather than maintainable code).
    + A time limit is useful to measure interest/technical ability of the candidate but then something like a 3 days is much more appropriate.
