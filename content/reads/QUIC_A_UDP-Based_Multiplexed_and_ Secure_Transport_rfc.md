short = "QUIC is a UDP based network protocol that will be the basis for HTTP/3. It moves much of the TCP logic from the network layer to the application layer. The implications of this are massive since hardware is very difficult to replace/upgrade compared with application code. It is also secure by default. Note: the pdf is of draft 32 of the QUIC transport protocol. The rfc is too large for a short summary but the PDF has been highlighted."
