### S
I was a technical contractor for SP.
They had a business goal which was to choose a contractor to help
them build a website, and back and also conduct some user surveys.

### T
I started the process by first identifying the overall architecture of the
applicaiton. The second step was to find a second contractor and then
interview both based on their technical expertise.

### A
After speaking with both and reviewing the technical spec I was of the
opinion that the original contractor did not have the technical
expertise however they did have the best business insight.

I recommended that there was a high risk of technical debt and that
we seek out the second contractor.

In the end my client decided to go with the first contractor. Their
primary concern was to reduce the number of parties involved and
since the first contractor was someone they were familiar with
they choose the more expensive and less technically stable option.

### R
Once the decision was made I supported the decision. The primarily
goal was to move forward and do everything in our power to allow
the first contractor to succeed.
