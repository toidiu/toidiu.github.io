disagree and commit: present the risks, push back on execution and technical ability. support decision and provide help going forward

#### metrics
- disagree
  - found an alternative contractor
    - interviewed 2 contractors
  - quantified the actual costs vs quoted costs from the contractor (asked for cost breakdown rather than lump sum)
  - pointed out faults with architecture (lambda is ephemeral and not good for DB connections)
  - US based was a positive for contractor
    - nudged them to find another US based contractor for comparison
- commit
  - decision was based on business needs (far greater than future tech challenges)
    - learned the value and a process of how to end a stalemate!
  - reviewed future API spec and noted on the strengths of the contractor
  - kept trust so that I could prove useful in helping them hire a full-time person to augment contractor

#### S
I was a technical advisor for SP. They had a business goal which was to choose a contractor to help them build a website, and back and also conduct some user surveys.

#### T
I started the process by first identifying the overall architecture of the applicaiton. The second step was to find a second contractor and then interview both based on their technical expertise.

#### A
After speaking with both and reviewing the technical spec I was of the opinion that the original contractor did not have the technical expertise however they did have the best business insight.

I recommended that there was a high risk of technical debt and that we seek out the second contractor.

In the end my client decided to go with the first contractor. Their primary concern was to reduce the number of parties involved and since the first contractor was someone they were familiar with they choose the more expensive and less technically stable option.

#### R
Once the decision was made I supported the decision. The primarily goal was to move forward and do everything in our power to allow the first contractor to succeed.

Recently my gut feeling has proven correct, in that the contractor is not very flexible technically or process wise and very expensive.
