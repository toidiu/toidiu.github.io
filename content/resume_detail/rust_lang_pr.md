#### S
I wanted to get involved in the OSS community, learn and give back. To force myself to do this I got involved during the impl days and claimed a feature that offered mentorship.

#### T
Understand the codebase. Understand the context around the feature. Understand the feature. Learn to work with the codebase. Commit a PR to implement the feature.

#### A
Learned to build and work in a large codebase. Took 7 months but from the moment I asked to work on the feature I knew that I had to finish it.

#### R
Added feature to infer predicates and thus made a small contibution to the ergonomics of the langugage.
Added docs for the feature.
