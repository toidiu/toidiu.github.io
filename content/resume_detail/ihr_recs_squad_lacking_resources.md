disagree and commit: point out the lack of resources. end up at a compromise

develop the best: involve and promote the design lead as the project leader

#### metrics
- attrition of 2 prod manager, 1 ios, 1 android
- rollout/feedback taking up to 2 weeks
- perliminary work being delayed for over a quarter
- raised issue with 1 prod manager, my manager, 2 design, 1 coworker

#### S
The company had experimented with a new team structure "vertical team". The goal of the team would be to focus on improving a KPI.

However, due to some employee churn and other org changes, the squads had started to lose direction.

The recs team did not have enough resources but was expected to produce results. This worked alright for previously started projects however new projects were
being proposed.

#### T
I had a strong hunch that without more  product involvement and dev resources the squad would not be able to succeed in its mission.

#### A
I took it upon myself to speak with the different stake holders involved. This involved the design team, a product manager I had a good relationship, a coworker and my manager.

After speaking with individuals I was able to propose a meeting where we could come together and discuss risks, and goals. We also took this time to re-evaluate goals under current circumstances.

#### R
I was able to convince my manager and org to reach a middle compromise. There would be a shift in roles. The designer, who had the best idea about the product direction would assume a temporary product manager role. Additionally, we would be able to get an iOS dev for 2 sprints to comsume and execute the feature.

With a reduction of scope and a more focused involvement of those part of the squad, I was able to shift my focus on other work that needed to be done while wrapping up and supporting previous features.
