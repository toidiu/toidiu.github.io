learn and be curious: curiosity of how things work. what is a timing belt. what is the effort involved

frugality: save money by doing the changes myself and then also in the future


#### metrics:
- $200 in tools and $200 in parts
- 5 days of work
- changed serpentine belts, timing belt 60k, radiator fluid, water pump

#### S
My first car was a mazda miata. I got it at 30K miles and at 60K it needed a timing belt changed.

#### T
I could have taken it to a mechanic but instead of paying upwards of hundreds of dollars, I decided to read and fix the car myself.

The parts cost around $200 and the tools cost another $200.

#### A
I confirmed that the risk was not too high. The engine was a noninterference engine so even if I messed up the timing, there would be no risk of distroying the engine.

Two other things that aided me was the amazing miata.net blog. I had a friend who I could ask for help when needed. He actually had a large wrench that I borrowed to turn the crankshaft bolt.

I read the instructions multiple times as well as comments from various other owners to predict all the things that could go wrong.

#### R
I was able to replace the belts and get the car running. I felt more comfortable debugging further problems with the car as they came up rather than trust a mechanic.

At the end I had the knowledge, the tools, and a working car.
