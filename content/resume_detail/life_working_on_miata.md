learn and be curious
  curiosity of how things work
  what is a timing belt
  what is the effort involved
frugality
  save money by doing the changes myself and then also in the future


#### S
My first car was a mazda miata. I got it at 30K miles and at 60K it needed a oil change.

I had done some small work like changing the oil but decided to change the timing belt, serpentine belt, radiator fluid and shift fluid myself.

#### T
I could have taken it to a mechanic but instead of paying upwards of hundreds of dollars, I decided to read and fix the car myself.

#### A
I confirmed that the risk was not too high. The engine was a non-impact engine so even if I messed up the timing, there would be no risk of distroying the engine.

I also read the instructions multiple times as well as comments from various other owners to predict all the things that could go wrong.

#### R
I was able to replace the belts and get the car running. I felt more comfortable debugging further problems with the car as they came up rather than trust a mechanic.
