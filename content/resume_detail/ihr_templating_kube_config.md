  - poc worked and was able to represent current config
- bads:
  - would be 1 additional tool to install
  - helm template was no longer supported
  - go templating had complicated syntax
- failures:
  - should have consulted seniors more (get buy in)
  - should have demonstrated small example rather go for the cake
  - should have asked for more feedback from team
