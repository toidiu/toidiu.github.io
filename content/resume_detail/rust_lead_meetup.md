#### S
Others bailed when it came time to actually put in time and organize the meetup. The tasks were no very rewarding and involved coordinating with companies, and speakers and trying to get sponsors.

#### T
I decided to take charge and try and build a sustainable community.

#### A
I created a list of companies.
I spoke to attendees and convinced a few to speak or otherwise host.
I invited everyone to speak on their side projects.
I organized a un-meetup and volunteered to teach the begineer session.

#### R
I was able to organize a meetup each month for approx 1.5 years before transitioning it to a co-organizer. We had average 30 people attending per meetup with upwards of 60 at a few events. We had a home for the meetup where we could each month and a sponsor who would provide food and drinks. There were approx 10 consistent member who would show up very often and would help carry it forward.
