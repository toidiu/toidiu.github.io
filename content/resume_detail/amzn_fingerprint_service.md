invent and simplify: re use hibernate codebase, especially the tests and validation. also simplify the logic to make it more adaptable.

bias for action: research other team's usecase; simplify and structure codebase to allow for extensibility. drove consensus when technical issues(java type generics) or framework choices made a right choice non obvious.

#### metrics
- eliminate 5-6 abstractions across 30 files
- structure code to support various types of fingerprints for various teams
- deliver a working first version of the API and provide value to the team. added testing for places where java type erasure made it difficult to add fully typed checked code.

- wrote prfaq to convince leadership
- learn and bootstrap out paperwork
  - unlocking team to move from substrate to prod
