- jvm debugging
- production outage - tracking list of services and restarting them

- commiting to rust lang issue and following thru on it (7 months)

- migrating old recs api to new micro service logic

 - debugging and optimizing Mongo query performance across different services
 - write unit and mongo embed tests across the many services
 - I interface with kubernetes on a daily basis. k8s is quite complex so many of the debugging tasks involve creating and refining the mental picture of how it actually works. This is then used to debug and further improve upon service performance.
