On being the best.

<!-- more -->

I am not perfect but I was taught to always strive to be the best. This can be
an exhausting endeavour but also what makes life interesting.

Recently I became a father. This I foolishly thought would be easy and come
naturally. I was very wrong about both these things. What I have realized
instead is that I need to really work at being being the best father. Yes not
good, but the best. Because it is important. Possibly the most important thing
I might do in my life. Because it has such a large impact on my child's life.

I believe, children learn by seeing what others do, so I also need to be the
best father, husband, son, cousin, friend, etc. This will be a living document
of how I can become the best at the important roles I occupy in my life.

## Best Father
- I will be generous with my time
- I will listen
- I wont get angry
- I will teach by example
- I will be supportive
- I will be non-judgmental
- I will forgive
- I will be patient
