On being the best.

<!-- more -->

I was taught to always strive to be the best. While this might seem like a
burden, I have come to realize that it is what makes life so interesting.

Recently I became a father. I was naive to think this would be easy or
naturally. It is anything but and you need to intentionally work really hard
to be a good father.

I want to be the best father. Not good, but the best. Because it is important.
Possibly the most important thing I might do in my life. Because it has such a
large impact on a child's life. And because this is my child.

## Father
- I will be generous with my time.
- I will believe in him. Always.
- I will tell him that he is good.
- I will listen.
- I wont get angry.
- I will teach by example.
- I will be non-judgmental.
- I will forgive.
- I will be patient.
