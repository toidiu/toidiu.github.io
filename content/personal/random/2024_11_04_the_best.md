On being the best.

<!-- more -->

Recently I became a father. I was naive to think this would be easy or
naturally. It is anything but. You need to intentionally work really hard
to be a good father.

I want to be the best father. Not good, but the best. Because it is important.
Possibly the most important thing I might do in my life. Because it has such a
large impact on a child's life. And because this is my child.

Children learn by example. You can tell them what to do but they are listening and
watching all the time. The way to teach them is to be the person you want them
to be. The following are a few roles I want to become better at.

## Father
- I will be generous with my time.
- I will believe in him. Always.
- I will tell him that he is good.
- I will listen.
- I wont get angry.
- I will teach by example.
- I will be non-judgmental.
- I will forgive.
- I will be patient.
