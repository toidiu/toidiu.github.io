Prepare the cocktail glass by chilling it.

Add all ingredients to a mixing glass. Fill mixing glass with lots of whole ice cubes (lots of ice allows us to control the dilution and get a cold cocktail). Stir till chilled.

Wash the cocktail glass with the vermouth (discard extra if you are working with a quality Gin).

Garnish is necessary and will depend on the gin. The Gin is the star here and The goal of the garnish is to enhance the Gin.
