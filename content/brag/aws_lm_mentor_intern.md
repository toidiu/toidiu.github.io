Project plan: https://quip-amazon.com/Wa4iADaP4cqI/Intern-Project-LM-Detective

### S
- The Dispatcher is a critical component in LM but our team lacked metrics.
- The intern project "LM Detective" would give us:
  - better understanding of Dispatcher Service and ongoing migrations
  - allow LM to take a data driven approach to improving the Dispatcher service and scheduling

### T
- Draft the intern project plan. Omitting some information to probe for understanding.
- Help onboard the intern to AWS and LM specific technology.
- Educate the intern about LM technology and help guide to a successful delivery.

### A
- Met with the intern multiple times a week to ensure progress.
- Guided the intern to set milestones and define a project plan.
- Helped define the stretch goals and helped prepare their final presentation.

### R
- The intern successfuly completed the project and received a return offer.
- LM could use the project to answer questions such as:
  - What is the state of the dispatcher given a specific migration id?
  - For all migrations in pending/executing state, what are the src droplets and tgt droplets?
  - Why is a particular migration in status pending?
- The intern also completed the stretch goal for the project
  - Create a UI (graph viz) to visualize the data
