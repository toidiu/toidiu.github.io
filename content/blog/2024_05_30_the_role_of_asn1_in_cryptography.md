ASN.1, PKCS #1, PKCS #8, pem, der, Pika Pika Chuuuu!

Ever feel like cryptography is just a
bunch of random acronyms that some just made up? I felt the same way and decided to change
that by figuring out how these things actually get used in real world cryptography.

### What is ASN.1?
In order to demystify the link between theory and application I will take a practical
first approach to dissecting this question. We will start by looking at a real ASN.1 object
before diving into the theory. Finally, we will tie it back to "real" cryptography by
seeing how these concepts are used in engineering.

#### Practical
We start by inspecting the ASN.1 object representation of the certificate of [this
website](https://lapo.it/asn1js/#MIIDoTCCA0egAwIBAgIQXQaw3dOjYeUOAEXcx7NKfzAKBggqhkjOPQQDAjA7MQswCQYDVQQGEwJVUzEeMBwGA1UEChMVR29vZ2xlIFRydXN0IFNlcnZpY2VzMQwwCgYDVQQDEwNXRTEwHhcNMjQwOTIzMTUwMDI4WhcNMjQxMjIyMTUwMDI3WjAVMRMwEQYDVQQDEwp0b2lkaXUuY29tMFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEk5N_4mwUFBbfq_DwqGxTtZDXQ-G_F9y9e5NYaXWS2HQsh6UwPMLrQRwlQ77OsWBW_z-HKtRwsY9QgrMVISYVlqOCAlEwggJNMA4GA1UdDwEB_wQEAwIHgDATBgNVHSUEDDAKBggrBgEFBQcDATAMBgNVHRMBAf8EAjAAMB0GA1UdDgQWBBSfYjReoEA85TK6jSVwxd2HjyfElzAfBgNVHSMEGDAWgBSQd5I1Z8T_qMyp5nvZgHl7zJP5ODBeBggrBgEFBQcBAQRSMFAwJwYIKwYBBQUHMAGGG2h0dHA6Ly9vLnBraS5nb29nL3Mvd2UxL1hRWTAlBggrBgEFBQcwAoYZaHR0cDovL2kucGtpLmdvb2cvd2UxLmNydDAjBgNVHREEHDAaggp0b2lkaXUuY29tggwqLnRvaWRpdS5jb20wEwYDVR0gBAwwCjAIBgZngQwBAgEwNgYDVR0fBC8wLTAroCmgJ4YlaHR0cDovL2MucGtpLmdvb2cvd2UxL1BDVWVRVmlRbFljLmNybDCCAQQGCisGAQQB1nkCBAIEgfUEgfIA8AB2AHb_iD8KtvuVUcJhzPWHujS0pM27KdxoQgqf5mdMWjp0AAABkh-c4_QAAAQDAEcwRQIhAJwMeBGNP9ofyl-PQ0AuL4qSkz9clmmZ175jDZYcNPSFAiBtZVemYmFbhFOch99Kq1EvAX4i_CroxuMRCJowzxitUgB2AEiw42vapkc0D-VqAvqdMOscUgHLVt0sgdm7v6s52IRzAAABkh-c5B4AAAQDAEcwRQIhAIh7iC-IxstglYu3qnIplFopHD6ixr3aAHyv5sZWTKEeAiAY_zjE9cj-pVehys2Sx0MZMnRVmmecrhNu0bDaA2P3HDAKBggqhkjOPQQDAgNIADBFAiEAvXutcWdEDhwh0yA6wxuYjWK-Z_ESF-apfTM8UZ340psCIAy2V8z3q5dPnyJ-hLfwQDh4yX5mD8yyTmwCirr12FwK).
Notice how the certificate is just big object with a bunch of different fields pertaining
to the [RFC 5280](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5280). See if you can find:
- The [Subject](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5280#section-4.1.2.6) which should be
  "toidiu.com".
- The [Issuer](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5280#section-4.1.2.4) which should be the
  intermediate ("WE1") and root ("Google Trust Services") certificates.
- The [Subject Public Key Info](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5280#section-4.1.2.7)
  associated with the certificate (search for "subjectPublicKeyInfo" and
  "subjectPublicKey"). This is the public key associated with the site "toidiu.com"
- Finally notice how
  [signatureAlgorithm](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5280#section-4.1.1.2) (search
  "signatureAlgorithm") is different from the Subject Public Key Info above. This is CA's
  (Certificate Authority) signature computed upon the contents of this certificate. This
  is what helps us verify that the CA has actually issued the certificate for
  "toidiu.com".

#### Theory
For a detailed dive into ASN.1, I highly recommend reading the post [Warm Welcome to ASN.1
and DER](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/a-warm-welcome-to-asn1-and-der). ASN.1 is an
interface definition language
([IDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_description_language)) (it defines an
interface to a system). An IDL needs to be able to do 2 things:
1. defining data structures (i.e. define structure of a certificate)
1. serialization and deserialization of those data structures

> The advantage of writing ASN.1 definitions instead of Go or C definitions is that they are
> language-independent.

While it is possible to represent a data structure in the language your application is written in
(e.g. Rust), the ASN.1 representation is language agnostic and can be used across multiple languages
(ASN.1 parser implementations are available for multiple languages).  I like to use the analogy of
Java, which allows you to "write code once, run anywhere". ANS.1 allows your to "define object and
serialize in one application, deserialize and reconstruct in any other application".

```
// C representation
struct point {
  int x, y;
  char label[10];
};

// Go representation
type point struct {
  x, y int
  label string
}

// ASN.1 representation is language agnostic
Point ::= SEQUENCE {
  x INTEGER,
  y INTEGER,
  label UTF8String
}
```

> There are some other languages that do the same things as ASN.1. For instance, Protocol Buffers
> offer both a language for defining types and a serialization format for encoding objects of the

> certificates (1988) and HTTPS (1994) were invented.


ASN.1, while not perfect (a ASN.1 parser is complicated to implement), has become the
standard in cryptography.

#### "Real" world usage
Now that we have an understanding of what ASN.1 objects are, lets see how we can make use
of them in real engineering applications. TLS, PKI, and VPNs are just a few examples where
these concepts are applied.

In the following code snippet we are encoding a private key as der and pem representation
of a ASN.1 object. In real cryptography we often have to do similar operations on other
secret material such as public key, certificates, etc.

```rust
// 1. generate cryptrographic key (ex. ecdhe)
let private_key = ecdhe_handshake();

// 2. generate a BIG_NUM
let big_num_key: BIG_NUM = BN_set_word(private_key);

// 3.
// asn1_obj = ASN.1: ()
//   - PKCS #1: defines the RSA format
//   - PKCS #8: defines the key format (RSA, EC, ..)
let asn1_obj = Pkcs8::new(private_key);

// 4: The der encoded ans1 object is simply the raw bytes
let der = asn1_obj.to_bytes();

// 5: The pem encoded asn1 object is the base64 encoding
// of the raw bytes
//
// pem = cat private_key.der | base64
let pem = der.to_base64();
```

1. `private_key`: private key generate perhaps from a key exchange
2. `big_num_key`: generate a [bignum](https://docs.openssl.org/1.0.2/man3/bn/#synopsis)
   from the private key
3.  create a `PKCS #8` encoded ASN.1 object: `asn1_obj`
  - [ASN.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASN.1): a language for defining data structure.
    In cryptography, we care about a few encodings:
      - `PKCS #1`: format for encoding and decoding RSA private and public keys
      - `PKCS #8`: format for encoding cryptographic private keys, often containing pairs of
        private and public keys. Can encode multiple key types (RSA, ECDSA, etc) and
        should be preferred over PKCS #1.
      - `X.509`: format for encoding digital certificates
4. `der` is just the raw bytes of the ans1 object
5. `pem` is the base64 representation of the der bytes


### Conclusion

In engineering applications we care about taking some secret material (key, certificate)
and serializing it so that we can then share (via network, file, memory) it our peer.

ASN.1 is the common format that cryptographic implementations have agreed upon. We looked
at PKCS #1 and PKCS #8 which are optional of ASN.1 formats used primarily for storing key
material (there are many other PKCS formats for different contexts). We also saw how the
binary representation of an ASN.1 object is called DER, and how PEM is simply the base64
representation.
