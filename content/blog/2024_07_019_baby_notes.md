A collection of notes when raising a baby.

<!-- more -->

**Feeding plan**
- **It is important to avoid large initial weight loss so might be better to give more than less. Baby will let you know when it is enough.**
- Not possible to overfeed with breast milk. give baby as much food as they will take.
- It is possible to give too much formula but difficult.
- 1st month. Goal is to have the baby breast feed over bottle. This develops good habits.
  - Pump for the ~1st week to raise supply.
  - Then stop pumping and prefer breast feeding
  - Can do 1 additional pump/day to build emergency supply in fridge.
- After 1st month??

**Breast milk**
- room temp for 4 hr
- fridge for 4 day
- freezer for 6 day

**Formula (ready-to-eat)**
- room temp for 1 hr
- fridge for 1 day

**Formula (powder)**
- baby can transition to this at anytime
- but the proteins are different than ready-to-eat so it takes time for baby to adjust.

**Sanitizing and Storage of equipment** ????
- Rinse with water immedetely and air dry
- If left out for long then rinse with warm-soapy water.
