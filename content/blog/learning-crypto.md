- Read the source of the libraries you use.
- Find people working in spaces closer to professional cryptography than you and ask them to help you (buy them beers or beverages of choice)
- Look at public issues on GitHub for libraries you use and see if you can contribute, or at least understand them
- Read _tons_ of specifications. You use AES-GCM? Read [NIST SP 800-38D](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-38d.pdf) You use HMAC? Read [RFC #2104](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2104)
- Read [The Stick-Figure Guide to AES](http://www.moserware.com/2009/09/stick-figure-guide-to-advanced.html)
- Read the [Latacora Blog](https://latacora.singles) (especially the "Right Answers")
- Read my [Cryptographic Gotchas](https://github.com/SalusaSecondus/CryptoGotchas) list.
- Read [If You’re Typing the Letters A-E-S Into Your Code You’re Doing It Wrong(link is broken)](https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blog/2009/july/if-youre-typing-the-letters-a-e-s-into-your-code-youre-doing-it-wrong/).

- Remember (and try to follow) any company/person mentioned in this list.

- KNOW YOUR LIMITS - Let me re-emphasize that last one. As everyone tells you, doing crypto is hard and dangerous. If you are confident that you're doing things right with no problems, you can't be trusted. You need to treat cryptography with the caution and respect it deserves. I can think of at least one coworker whose cryptography I don't trust because he is over-confident in his own abilities. (And his skills are better than mine. Still, I'm more trusted because I'm more cautious.)
