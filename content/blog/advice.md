    -- Daniel

- There are two hard things in computer science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors.
    -- Leon

    -- Mathias

- Among the maxims on Lord Naoshige's wall there was this one: "Matters of great concern should be treated lightly." Master lttei commented, "Matters of small concern should be treated seriously." Among one's affairs there should not be more than two or three matters of what one could call great concern. If these are deliberated upon during ordinary times, they can be understood. Thinking about things previously and then handling them lightly when the time comes is what this is all about.
    -- Yamamoto

    -- Maria

- The universe tends toward maximum irony. Don't push it.
    -- Jamie

- The universe seeks equilibriums; it prefers to disperse energy, disrupt organization, and maximize chaos. Life is designed to combat these forces. We slow down reactions, concentrate matter, and organize chemicals into compartments; we sort laundry on Wednesdays.

- A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin with fine calipers, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and developers.
    -- Jim

    -- Benjamin

- Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.
    -- Harold

- Adjectives are like lard. They make all writing flabby.
    -- Jake

- New organs of perception come into being as a result of necessity. Therefore, O man, increase your necessity, so that you may increase your perception.

    -- Wendell

- [HSMs] are not a sustainable operational load.
    -- Todd

- The only good thing about [certificate] pinning is that it makes revocation seem like a good idea.
    -- Trevor

    -- James Mickens, "This World of Ours"

- It's a program, not a project.

## Books

- Required books for an SDE I

  - The Design of Everyday Things: More than a book about physical design, it illustrates how you actually obsess over customers.
  - Every Computer Performance Book: How to Avoid and Solve Performance Problems on The Computers You Work With: This deceptively simple book will give you a grounding in the basics of keeping complex systems running, and improving them as you go.

- Useful books for all SDEs and SDMs

  - How Big Things Get Done, by Bent Flyvbjerg and Dan Gardner. Most projects come in late and over budget. This book will help you avoid that.
  - The Design of Design: Essays from a Computer Scientist: By Fred Brooks, the author of the “Mythical Man-Month.” These essays are underrated gold.
  - The Elements of Style, by Strunk and White: At some point in your career, you realize that the majority of your writing is for other people. If it's in English, let this be your constant companion.
  - The Systems Bible: The Beginner's Guide to Systems Large and Small: At first, you laugh at all the jokes. Then you realize he's describing a situation that came up in a recent COE. Then you stop laughing. And then you realize this is a bundle of koans for system designers and operators.
  - The Utopia of Rules: On Technology, Stupidity, and the Secret Joys of Bureaucracy: Sophisticated, intelligent critiques of complex bureaucratic systems (and their critics).

- Books specific to TLS, PKI or cryptography

  - Bulletproof TLS and PKI, by Ivan Ristic. The most comprehensive work on the subject.
  - Real-World Cryptography, by David Wong. I'm not a cryptographer. My mathematical abilities are not strong, and yet this book filled in a lot of the gaps in my cryptographic knowledge..
