                I am a problem solver and a fast learner with a focus on building resilient and highly scalable solutions.
                My approach begins with gaining a deep understanding of the product requirements and client needs before designing solutions to solve
                those problems within a certain time. Testing is at the core of this.

                My work has allowed me to work across the application landscape (infra/SRE, BE, mobile, web, embedded); from which I have gained a
                deeper appreciation of the trade-offs and priorities associated at each layer. This insight, I find is critical for quickly and efficiently
                reaching a decision when designing interfaces between the different layers.

                I have worked with a multitude of tools and languages, but I prefer to work with strongly typed and statically complied languages.
                To this end my languages of choice are <span class="red">Rust</span> and <span class="red">Scala</span>.

                My platform of choice is <span class="red">Kubernetes</span>; which I have used to create more reliable and efficient workflows.
