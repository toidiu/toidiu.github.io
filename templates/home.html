                I am a problem solver and a fast learner with a focus on building resilient and highly scalable solutions.
                My approach begins with gaining a deep understanding of the product requirements and client needs before
                designing solutions within a clear timeframe. Testing is at the core of this process.

                My experience has allowed me to work across the application landscape (infra/SRE, BE, mobile, web, embedded); from which I have gained a
                deeper appreciation of the trade-offs and priorities associated with each layer. This insight I find is critical for quickly and efficiently
                reaching a decision when designing interfaces across layers.

                I have worked with a multitude of tools and languages, but I prefer to work with strongly typed and statically complied languages.
                To this end my languages of choice are <span class="important">Rust</span> and <span class="important">Scala</span>.

                My platform of choice is <span class="important">Kubernetes</span>, which I have used to create more reliable and efficient workflows.
